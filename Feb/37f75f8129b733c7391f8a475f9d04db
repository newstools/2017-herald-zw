Taurai MangwiroOscar Rusenga in TrianglePREMIERSHIP club Triangle are set to name Taurai Mangwiro as their new head coach this week. Mangwiro is currently employed as the ZIFA technical director but is set to dump the Association for a job back in the trenches of the domestic Premiership. The Herald revealed last week that Mangwiro has emerged as the preferred choice for the Lowveld side and negotiations, which have been on-going, are now set to be concluded this week.Triangle did not renew the contracts of coach David Mandigora, assistant coach Biggie Zuze and goalkeepers coach Tembo Chuma after a disappointing season last year.Their replacements, Godfrey Tamirepi and Innocent Chogugudza, have already been secured and are now being housed at Triangle Country Club.The two were hand-picked by Mangwiro.The club tried to lure Mohammed Fathi from Zambia but the Egyptian was disappointed with delays in the conclusion of the deal and decided to stay in Zambia.Mangwiro, who has a contract with ZIFA, referred all questions to Triangle. If there is anything they (Triangle) will issue an official statement but at the moment the only contract I have is with ZIFA and I am concentrating on my job as a technical director here, he said. Of course, coaches are nomads, we move around and I cannot rule out a move. Club chairman Lovemore Matikinyidze, however, played down reports that Mangwiro will be unveiled this week. It s still work in progress and that s all I can say for now. I will not comment any further, Matikinyidze said.
