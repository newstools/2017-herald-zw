DAREDEVIL Zimbabwean ace driver Axcil Jefferies negotiates his car during the race in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, at the weekendABU DHABI The young drivers Axcil Jefferies and Rik Breukers took the rewards of a weekend that saw them shine during all sessions, except for Race 1 where they went faultlessly out of the race for a contact at the first corner. Race 2, which took place on Saturday at the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi, has seen the crew of the Huracan Super Trofeo Number 7 fielded by GDL Racing winning the race, thanks to a very fast race pace and to perfect conduct of both PRO drivers.Starting from pole position, thanks to the best time clocked in qualifying, the 18-year-old Rik Breukers, member of the Lamborghini Young Drivers Programme, immediately gave the first position to Marco Antonelli, author of a calibrated overtake at the first corner and winner of Race 1 on Friday.But after six laps in a qualifying pace for both drivers, Breukers found his way to recover the lead.After the drivers change, the 22-year-old driver coming from the GP2 Series, Jefferies, continued to lead the race, with a very fast and steady pace.Davide Roda has managed well the second position until the end of the race, stemming the comeback of Huracan Number 27 of Bertuzzi and Farmer (GDL Racing, PRO-AM) who finished in third place.The PRO class saw the duo of GDL Racing Breukers-Jefferies winning the race and behind them, in the second and third position (5th and 7th overall), were the two crews of the FFF Racing Team by ACM: the first formed by the American Richard Goddard and the 19-year-old German female driver Carrie Schreiner. Yesterday was certainly not a good day, after the contact at the first corner, but today we definitely happy, said Jefferies. Rik did an amazing stint and regarding me I tried to keep a steady and fast pace, which allowed us to win. The Super Trofeo Middle East will take place at the Dubai Autodrome this week from February 16 to 18. Agencies
