Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter OVER 20 schools will today converge at Dominican Convent School for the Clash of Titans Karate tournament. The inter-schools competition is being organised by Dominican Convent and will see 135 upcoming karatekas from different schools compete in individuals and team events. The tournament was first held in 2015 and bounces back today after taking a break last year.Dominican Convent karate head coach, Winston Nyanhete, said the event presents the young fighters with a platform to showcase their talent and also get the much-needed exposure for bigger tournaments. The tournament is meant to get exposure for athletes in schools. Dominican Convent has the highest number of representatives in national teams. So we are trying to spread that exposure because some who do not get selected it s because they are not exposed. We have got 27 schools that have registered, primary and secondary. There are 135 athletes. We closed registration yesterday (Thursday). It s a combined competition for primary and secondary schools. We are going to have individual and team events. Some schools do not have established karate so they are sending individuals, said Nyanhete.Nyanhete said following the inclusion of karate into the Olympic Games, junior development is key if the country is to qualify for the Games. Karate in the school circuit has not been done in years. So we are trying to bring back karate into the school circuit. Right now karate was accepted into the Olympics, so having karate in schools is good platform to start development. Hopefully we will send a team (in 2020), said Nyanhete.Some of the schools expected to take part in today s competition are Peterhouse, Prince Edward, Mazowe Boys and Falcon College.Nyanhete, who is a fifth dan black belt holder, said Zimbabwe Karate Union executive led by president, Paul Danisa is expected to grace the event.
