MANCHESTER. Pep Guardiola has told nice guy Fernandinho he does not need to change his English style of play, despite being sent off three times in his last six appearances. The Manchester City midfielder has missed eight of the club s last 11 matches because of suspension, having been dismissed against Borussia Moenchengladbach in the Champions League in November, then against Chelsea and Burnley in the English Premier League.He was sent off for two bookable offences against Moenchengladbach, saw red towards the end of the Chelsea defeat on December 3 for shoving Cesc Fabregas over an advertising hoarding, and was dismissed in the first half of the victory over Burnley on January 2 for a two-footed challenge on Johann Berg Gudmundsson.Guardiola believes the sending off against Burnley was harsh and thinks that the Brazil international is perfectly suited to the English game.For that reason, the City manager feels the midfielder has no need to adapt his game. He s not an aggressive player, Guardiola said. He s a tough player, an intense player, like players in English football are. He s one of the nicest guys I ve ever met. When you re a nice guy off the pitch, you are a nice guy on it, the Spaniard added. AFP.
