Ellina Mhlanga:Sports ReporterAFTER a remarkable year that saw them qualifying for the Netball World Youth Cup to be held in July, Under-21 coach Ropafadzo Mutsauki is convinced with proper preparations they can leave a mark at the competition. The world event will be held in Gaborone, Botswana, from July 8 to 16 with 20 countries taking part. Zimbabwe will be up against South Africa and 2013 losing finalists Australia in Pool B. The other teams in the pool are Barbados and Singapore.However, Mutsauki is not reading much into that. South Africa and Australia are the big guns so we are going into the pool as the underdogs. But if you are well prepared and underrated you can utilise on that. We have a good team. We have an advantage that three quarters of the team that qualified, the players are still around so they just need more time together, said Mutsauki.Mutsauki said they lost two key players captain Felistas Kwangwa who graduated into the senior team and goalkeeper Sithembile Chitiva. But is confident they will find suitable replacements for the two. Right now our team has more players. I beefed up the squad because I want to choose the best. I have 24 players. I am working much more on the defence because we lost two key players. We are looking forward to an early camp in April and will trim the team to 14 players. What is important is to see that the players are training and if they will all be still in the system by the time of the games, said Mutsauki.Pool A: New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Samoa.Pool B: Zimbabwe, Australia, South Africa, Barbados and Singapore.Pool C: Jamaica, Botswana, Cook Islands, Malaysia, Uganda.Pool D: England, Fiji, Trinidad and Tobago, Wales, Grenada.
