David Swanson CorrespondentIt was bound to be the case that if a US president ever admitted that the United States murdered people and did so on a scale at least as significant as other countries, he would be defending the practice, not denouncing it. It is not a secret in much of the world that the United States is (as Martin Luther King Jr. put it) the greatest purveyor of violence on earth.The United States is the top weapons dealer, the top weapons buyer, the biggest military spender, the most widespread imperial presence, the most frequent war maker, the most prolific over-thrower of governments, and from 1945 to 2017 the killer of the most people through war.During this past US election, a debate moderator asked if a candidate would be willing to kill thousands of innocent children as part of basic presidential duties.One can find many faults in Russia and other countries, but in none could one find such an occurrence.I ask people at public events where I speak to name eight countries bombed under president Barack Obama, and most cannot come close.Nowhere else on earth can people not keep track of their wars.During this last presidency, the United States developed a new policy of murdering people with missiles from drones. Other nations do not yet have anything to match it.Hillary Clinton told Goldman Sachs bankers that a no-fly zone in Syria would require killing lots of Syrians, but told the public that a no-fly zone should be created.Russia over the years has proposed complete nuclear disarmament, significant overall disarmament, a ban on weapons in space, and a peace settlement in Syria.The United States has broken promises, laws and morality to expand Nato and its troops to Russia s border.The reality of US foreign relations is generally treated as fake news. So, when someone like Donald Trump, who pushes lies and disasters like they re going out of style, blurts out some truth, Democratic partisans are eager to denounce it.But their blind partisan patriotism just reinforces the truth of what Trump said.As he pursues policies of stealing oil and killing families he is adding nothing new to the United States record.Killing has been the primary investment of federal discretionary spending since long before the days of the Bowling Green Massacre.&nbsp;David Swanson wants you to declare peace at http://WorldBeyondWar.org His new book is War No More: The Case for Abolition.
