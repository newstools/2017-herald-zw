Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter FORMER Harare City talisman Raphael Manuvire and Obey Mwerahari have retraced their roots back to the resort town of Kariba where they have rejoined their former club ZPC Kariba. Manuvire, together with utility player Mwerahari, have joined the Sunday Chidzambwa-coached side for the 2017 season. Manuvire was with Harare City last season, but failed to make an impression the Sunshine Boys had hoped he will bring.He also had a fallout with coach Moses Chunga and was dumped from the first team. The player later apologised and was restored to the team, but still, failed to produce the magic.Mwerahari arrives at ZPC Kariba from Dynamos. He was one of the best players in a disappointing DeMbare side last year. Meanwhile, FC Platinum have signed Warriors defender Lawrence Mhlanga on a three-year contract.The former Chicken Inn defender will be a big addition to Norman Mapeza s side. FC Platinum spokesperson Chido Chizondo confirmed that Mhlanga has joined the ambitious Zvishavane side on a three-year contract.
