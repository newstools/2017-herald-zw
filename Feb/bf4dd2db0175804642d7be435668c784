But Econet insisted the meeting should go ahead, arguing that the ZSE board had no authority to stop the EGM.And with Econet in mind, and at an internal level, the ZSE has said investigations into the conduct of its chief executive Alban Chirume, who was sent on forced leave, would not be restricted to this debacle but will spread into other unprocedural and unethical conduct allegedly committed by him over a period of time.This comes after the ZSE board sent Chirume on forced leave pending investigations mainly emanating from the debacle into Econet s $130 rights issue which exposed the disconnect between the exchange s board and its management.In the last five trading days the mainstream Industrials Index gained a marginal 0,02 percent to 141,28 on mixed performance by both top cap counters and mid tiers.The Minings Index of four counters jumped 17 percent to 60,73 on gains in nickel miner Bindura.Total market capitalisation added 0,44 percent or $17 million to $3,938 billion.
