Paidamoyo Chipunza Senior Reporter Government is committed to engaging multinational companies on a win-win basis and many have expressed willingness to work with Zimbabwe, Finance and Economic Development Minister Patrick Chinamasa has said. Speaking at the official signing of a humanitarian aid, technical and financial co-operation agreement with Switzerland in Harare on Thursday, Minister Chinamasa said Government was engaging multinational companies operating in Zimbabwe to ensure a win-win situation. We want to engage them on an equal basis. What we have said to them is that, let us have a dialogue. We want them to stay and become key players in our economy, said Minister Chinamasa.He, however, said there were sticking issues that needed to be ironed out in relation to royalties and management fees, among others.Minister Chinamasa said Government was also training staff from the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority to be able to analyse financial statements of multinational companies.Turning to the agreement, Minister Chinamasa appreciated the gesture saying it was a clear testimony by the Swiss government of its commitment to work with Zimbabwe. Indeed, our efforts to re-engage and partner with the international community continue to yield fruits as we are gathered here to witness the signing of this agreement, which seeks to reaffirm and strengthen the co-operation between our two countries, said Minister Chinamasa.He said the partnership was expected to promote sustainable socio-economic development, strengthen service delivery, strengthen institutions in technical areas and promote peace and governance.The Swiss ambassador to Zimbabwe and Malawi, Mrs Ruth Huber, said her country was committed to continue working with Zimbabwe as evidenced by the signing of the agreement.Mrs Huber said her government was currently working on a five-year strategy that will see its contribution to Zimbabwe increased from $8 million in 2016 to $10 million each year from 2017.She, however, urged Government to solve pending issues with Swiss investors, especially by recognising the debt to farmers who lost their properties during the agrarian reform programme.Swiss-owned companies operating in Zimbabwe include Lafarge Cement, Bata and Nestle. Switzerland stands ready to continue supporting the arrears clearance process with the international financial institutions, which will pave way for investment in the country, she said.Switzerland has been assisting Zimbabwe since 2008 in various projects ranging from health, agriculture and institutional building to the tune of over $100 million.
