Last month, Police Commissioner-General Augustine Chihuri accused some officers manning roadblocks of corruption. He said a number had been dismissed from the force, but also blamed motorists for offering bribes, instead of paying legal fines.He said it was a misconception that the police kept money properly raised from roadblocks, which they deposit into a bank account administered by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.Comm-Gen Chihuri told legislators from the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Peace and Security, and Home Affairs and Security Services on a familiarisation tour of several police projects in Harare that police did not set targets for fine collections at roadblocks.
