Gift MuzadziPaul Mundandi in ZambiaNGEZI Platinum Stars shot-stopper Nelson Chadya was the toast of the Zambian tour when he stole the show in an international friendly against champions Zanaco at Nkoloma Stadium over the weekend. And the young keeper wants to do even better. I am very happy because it was a great performance from me against the biggest team in Zambia, he told The Herald. I was excited to deny the top players here, I enjoyed every moment. My attachment with the national team helped me a lot. I still want to compete for the first team jersey in the Warriors and I am going to give it another shout. We did not have a goalkeeper s coach and the arrival of (Gift) Muzadzi has helped me a lot. I still want to learn and I am grateful to all the encouragement I am getting from the technical team and fans. I have been flying the national team flag at the Under-20 level and I am going to do the same in the Confederation Cup. Chadya is 19-years-old. Muzadzi, who joined Ngezi a few weeks ago, tipped Chadya for greatness. He is going to be one of the best goalkeepers in the country. He might not be in the limelight like Mhari (Petros) or Tatenda (Mukuruva) but he is going to surprise many. He is just an ordinary but humble guy. Zanaco chairman David Mutale also heaped praises on the keeper. That goalkeeper is good and he denied my players several times. We should have beaten the Zimbabwe team. Sooner, rather than later, he is going to be snatched by some big clubs.
