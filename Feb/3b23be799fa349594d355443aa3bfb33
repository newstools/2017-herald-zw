Courage Nyamhunga Our Children Our FutureThe Internet has dramatically revolutionised the world in ways that have changed our existence. What started out as a means to shuttle small bytes of information between two terminals, has now invaded every aspect of our lives. Nothing else has so radically shaped culture, media, commerce, entertainment, and communication. As amazing as the internet is, it is also fraught with real and present dangers, especially for our children. We ve all heard the stories &#8211; young girls being stalked online by sexual predators, teenagers being led to suicide due to incessant cyber-bullying, or even being lured into slavery.February 7 marks Safer Internet Day, a day to raise awareness on cyberbullying, stalking and all the ills that come with accessing the Internet. It is a day that also stresses the positive, supportive aspects of children s online lives. Looking into the exponential growth of the national internet penetration, UNICEF Zimbabwe is committed to ensuring the safe, responsible and positive use of digital technology for children and young people.This year s theme is running under the title Be the change: Unite for a better iInternet . The Internet is important to young people s lives and their friendships, for the majority of the connected young people in Zimbabwe, through the feedback from our U-Reporters, the internet is a positive place.Though it can be a positive place where they can engage with the world, some still do not have a good time being online. It is our collective responsibility to unite for a better internet that protects the wellbeing of our children and young people.In December 2015, through U-Report we ran a poll on the Internet of Good Things. The poll was entirely meant to understand some of the challenges faced by young people in trying to access the internet and a staggering 37 percent of the respondents cited access to network as one major hurdle.Through the results gathered 40 percent of the U-Reporters said that they use the Internet for educational purposes, while others said, they use it for career guidance and health related information.Through the Internet young people are seizing the opportunity to engage with new technologies; they are doing brilliant things, gaining new skills for the future of work, being creative and becoming active citizens.At the same time, let s not ignore the myriad challenges that confront these young people as a result of using the Internet.As U-Report through the work of our partners such as Youth Advocates Zimbabwe, Restless Development and SAYWHAT, we are striving to offer personalised counselling services online and safe spaces where young people can get help in real time.UNICEF globally is testing the efficacy of the Internet of Good Things, a set of free mobile-ready, web-based resources and applications that bring good life and education to children with no internet access. This is how on our end we are making the internet better.This project is aimed at giving information and advice to keep young people and families healthy and safe.Through the internet of good things, UNICEF has spaces such as, Facts for Life, Connect Smart and All In. These are spaces that provide vital information that saves lives and improves health status of every child.The information they provide includes that about waterborne diseases such as typhoid, benefits of immunising children and how to be safe during emergencies.At Unicef we are making the Internet better for every child, by making it more beneficial to children and young people as we provide Facts for Life, encouraging young people to get All In to access more information about the world we live in and helping them to Connect Smart. For every child, their voice matters.For comments and contributions, please email: [email&#160;protected]
