WASHINGTON. Canada s tennis star Eugenie Bouchard, ranked 45th in the WTA rankings after a third-round run at the Australian Open, has a date with a stranger after losing a Super Bowl bet. Bouchard says she will honour a promise to go on a blind date with a Twitter follower after losing a Super Bowl bet. The 22-year-old Montreal-born blonde learned the hard way on Sunday never to bet against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots, who rallied from a 25-point deficit to defeat Atlanta 34-28 in overtime to claim the NFL crown.With the Falcons comfortably ahead 21-0 after running back an intercepted Brady pass for a touchdown, Bouchard was confident enough in Atlanta to start sending Twitter messages predicting victory. I knew Atlanta would win btw, she tweeted, later adding, Just predicted the future .So that prompted TW1, a Twitter identity sporting a photo of a man in a Cleveland Cavaliers NBA jersey, to tweet Bouchard with a longshot bid of his own. if patriots win we go on a date? came the pitch. Sure, Bouchard replied, although she shot down a second such suitor with merely C mon&#8230; As the Patriots made their successful second-half comeback, Bouchard was asked by another tweeter: are you getting nervous?!? Lol. Umm&#8230;kinda&#8230;, she replied, adding later, So&#8230;where do you live? AFP&nbsp;
