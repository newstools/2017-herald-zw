KUALA LUMPUR. South African golfer Charl Schwartzel is eyeing more major success this season, as he tees off in his first tournament of the year in Malaysia this week. Schwartzel (32) won the coveted Masters green jacket at Augusta National Golf Club in 2011 and is an 11-time European Tour winner. Schwartzel has recently recovered from a knee injury, which kept him out of the game for more than a month.The World No. 26 will headline the Maybank Championship in Malaysia along with reigning Masters champion Danny Willett from England. The South African comes to Malaysia with experience having competed five times in the Malaysian Open. (The injury break) has actually allowed me to be a lot fresher than I think I would have been, to sort out some of my clubs and get some practice done to get my game in shape, Schwartzel told the European Tour website. I think overall it s been a good thing. It s been nine weeks since I last played competitively and it s the freshest I ve ever been. AFP.
