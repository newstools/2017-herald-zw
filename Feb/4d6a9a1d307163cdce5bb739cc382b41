NAIROBI. &#8211; Doctors in Kenya s private medical facilities have resolved to strike for 48-hours in solidarity with their public-sector colleagues who were jailed on Monday. A statement from the heads of 16 medical associations issued on February 14, 2017, said negotiations with government had also been suspended till the seven doctors are released. There can be no negotiations if the doctors are in jail, the statement read.The latest move effectively means that the East African country will not be with any doctors administering services. The 48-hour strike is expected to commence at midnight today; the national chair of the Kenya Medical Association said.Meanwhile, over 5 000 doctors converged for a 30-day vigil at the prisons on Monday night for the jailed doctors. &#8211; Africa News.
