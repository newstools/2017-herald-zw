DUBAI. &#8211; One of the most famous people in the US, Tiger Woods is urging his compatriots to unite during some turbulent times the country has arguably been recently experiencing. The former world No. 1 golfer encouraged Americans to come together and do what s best for our country, speaking to CNN s Living Golf show in DubaiWoods was talking in the aftermath of President Trump s controversial immigration ban, which has caused ructions in the US and throughout the rest of the world.Trump s order has suspended the US refugee system for 120 days, suspended the Syrian refugee program indefinitely, and banned entry from seven Muslim countries &#8211; Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen &#8211; for 90 days, among other things. We need to unite, and be Americans, said Woods, who played golf with the then president-elect in December. I know there is a lot of divisiveness as of right now but time, patience and unity I think will win out. The 41-year-old, who makes his second appearance of the year in Dubai this week, feared he would never play golf again during dark times as he recovered from multiple back surgeries in late 2015. &#8211; CNN.&nbsp;
