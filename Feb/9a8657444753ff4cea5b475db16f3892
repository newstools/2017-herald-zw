LIVERPOOL. Jurgen Klopp said faltering Liverpool must take the blame for their performances after a 2-0 defeat at lowly Hull added to their miserable run on Saturday. Klopp admitted it was impossible for him to defend criticism of his players attitude as Liverpool s season reached its nadir.Liverpool have come off the rails in 2017, winning only one of their last 10 matches in all competitions. They are without a win in the English Premier League since December 31 and Klopp accepted they have a battle on their hands to qualify for Europe.It should not be this way, though, as Liverpool are unbeaten in games against the top six sides this year they have taken 13 points from seven games against the two Manchester clubs, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham but have floundered against teams at the bottom end.The German boss said the Reds have got to turn words into actions after failing to win any of their five league games this year the first time that has happened since 1954.Klopp said there has got to be an immediate change to reach the big, big target of the Champions League.Liverpool s only victory in the last 10 matches in all competitions came in an FA Cup replay at fourth tier Plymouth.More damning, Saturday s loss at Hull means the relegation-threatened hosts joined a list that features Burnley, Swansea and Bournemouth among clubs to have inflicted league defeats on Liverpool this season.In contrast, Liverpool have the best record in the Premier League when playing sides currently in the top six. We have to take all the criticism from everywhere, said Klopp when asked if he thought there was a flaw in his team s attitude. AFP.
