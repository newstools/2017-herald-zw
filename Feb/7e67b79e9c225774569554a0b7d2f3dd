LONDON. Almost 20 years on and thousands of miles away, Nwankwo Kanu still gets regularly reminded about his greatest day in an Arsenal shirt. It came in October 1999 when Kanu inspired the Gunners to one of their most memorable wins at Chelsea. After wiping out the Blues 2-0 lead, Kanu completed the comeback and his brilliant hat-trick with a goal that went down in club folklore.With seconds to spare, he charged down Albert Ferrer s clearance, rounded keeper Ed de Goey near the corner flag and, from an improbable angle, whipped a stunning finish into the far corner over Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf.After their shock home defeat to Watford, Arsene Wenger s current crop now need an incredible comeback of a different kind in the title race.They could do worse than take inspiration from Kanu and co when they visit the Bridge again for today s lunchtime London derby. Gunners favourite Kanu said: Whenever everybody sees me and it is something to do with Chelsea, even the fans in Nigeria, they are always trying to curse me and say, Why did you score that goal? But then the Arsenal fans are happy. They always remind Chelsea fans Can you remember what Kanu did against your team? You live with that. If you ask me the greatest goal I have ever scored, that is what I would say. Chelsea then were really good. They hadn t lost any home game. From being two down to make it 2-2 and then to score that wonderful goal from the line after dribbling the keeper, that was my best day for Arsenal. The Mirror.
