MANCHESTER. &#8211; Manchester City fear Brazilian new boy Gabriel Jesus could miss the rest of the season after sustaining a foot injury.Jesus, who finalised his 27million move to City in January, suffered a knock to his foot during his side s 2-0 win over Bournemouth on Monday night and is expected to be out for three months with a broken metatarsal. The Brazilian forward was forced off with the injury after just 15 minutes and his short Vitality Stadium cameo could prove to be his last appearance of the campaign.Jesus (19) has hit the ground running since joining from Palmeiras by scoring three goals in five appearances for his new side.Pep Guardiola made the bold decision to drop star striker Sergio Aguero but the Argentine is likely to be given another chance to impress his manager.The Spanish tactician said after Monday night s match that he was praying Jesus would only face a short spell on the sidelines however his fears may have been realised.Aguero took his chance with both hands as he played a key role in City s second goal despite the strike being attributed to Bournemouth defender Tyrone Mings. &#8211; Mailonline.&nbsp;
