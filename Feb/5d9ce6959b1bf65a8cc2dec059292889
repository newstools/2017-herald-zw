Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter CAPS United supporters believe their team will make a huge impression in the CAF Champions League this year.Moses Magawa, the CAPS United Supporters Association secretary, said they were fully behind their team. We have a 70-seater bus that will ferry our supporters to rally behind our team. It has been long since we participated in the continental showcase and we need to rally behind the team. We are hopeful we will do well in the tournament as we will be behind them throughout. We are very confident that we will progress to the next stage, the team is good and we still have that team we had last season with only a few additions and the players understand each other well. We are calling on all supporters to rally behind us as this is a national cause. We also thank all the chapters who made the trip possible as we will give the team the support they desire in Lesotho, said Magawa.
