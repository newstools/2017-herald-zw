LONDON. Arsenal legend Thierry Henry admits he couldn t say no to the manager s job in the future if he were ever offered the chance to lead his old club. Arsene Wenger s position at the Emirates Stadium has come under increased scrutiny of late after a wretched run of results has all but killed off their title dreams for the season. Still, Henry is aware that he s not currently in any position to take on such a big job, though he didn t rule it out as an ambition of his for the future. I will not say no (to coaching Arsenal one day), he admitted to RMC. If I say no, I would be lying. I have to respect that there are people who are in place there already. I have not done anything as a coach. What I feel for Arsenal is true and (I have felt it) for a long time. I m not going to say it does not make me cold or hot. I think about it, but I m far from it. Another former Arsenal captain William Gallas has given his opinion on the difference between Jose Mourinho and Wenger, and believes that the lack of mentality in the Frenchman is why Arsenal now need to make a change of manager.Gallas captained Arsenal under Wenger s reign from August 2008 until November 2009, when he was stripped of the armband after criticising the younger players in the squad at the time. The former defender, who retired in 2014, went on to play for Arsenal for another season before joining arch-rivals Tottenham, but he is one of seven players to have been managed by both Wenger and Mourinho thanks to his time at Chelsea early in his career.Gallas won the English Premier League title twice in his career with the Blues, but failed to win a trophy during his time at the Emirates Stadium and he believes that Arsenal s 12-year wait for the title is reason enough to end Wenger s 20-year reign at the club.
