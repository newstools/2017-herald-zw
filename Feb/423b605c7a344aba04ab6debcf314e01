MELBOURNE. &#8211; New Zealand has moved the fourth one-day international cricket match against South Africa away from Napier s McLean Park after an investigation into an abandoned match against Australia found problems with drainage and irrigation at the venue. New Zealand s cricket board was embarrassed two weeks ago when a one-dayer between the hosts and Australia was called off without a single ball bowled after the outfield failed to drain enough despite dry conditions that following morning rain.An urgent investigation into the ground had found there was an unacceptable risk of a repeat drainage failure and the March 1 match had been switched to Hamilton s Seddon Park, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said in a statement yesterday. An investigation into the circumstances surrounding the recently abandoned ODI against Australia at McLean Park has highlighted a need for urgent remedial work on the venue s turf, drainage, and irrigation system, NZC said.NZC said, due to drought conditions, the ground had been given significant watering before the match against Australia and the match-day rain had resulted in a worst-case scenario . &#8211; Reuters.&nbsp;
