Sheikh Abdullah Makwinja Correspondent THE current month of February will usher the Islamic Revolution in Iran into its 38th year. The past years have not been easy by any means. This Islamic Revolution had to sweat and bleed at every turn during the past 38 painstaking years. The Islamic Revolution gained final victory on February 11, 1979 after years of struggle, self-sacrifice and resistance for the sake of God, thanks to sage leadership of Imam Khomeini and efforts of the honourable people of Iran.The birth of that self-governing, democratic, autonomous, and self-reliant Islamic state created waves of excitement and eruption of euphoria throughout the Muslim world. Even other oppressed peoples began to look up to this nascent Islamic model of insusceptibility with hopes and prospects.On the other hand the arrogant powers would not welcome a free, independent, and sovereign newcomer into the geopolitical sphere. From the troubled psychology of disturbed imperialists, a war of aggression and occupation was launched on their behalf by the Iraqi Ba thi regime when this Islamic state was still in its cradle.Please note, the Iraqi regime was not the antagonist in this war; it was only a channel for the will of the great powers.The real antagonists in the conflict were the imperialists who divide the oppressed peoples of the world among themselves and control them.What began as warfare against the Islamic Republic of Iran in the 1980s turned into economic, financial, and monetary sanctions against the Islamic Republic at the turn of the century.Despite all the hurdles, Iran has made considerable advances in science and technology through education and training, despite international sanctions in almost all aspects of research during the past 30 years.Iran s university population swelled from 100 000 in 1979 to two million in 2006, 70 percent of its science and engineering students are women.Iran s scientific progress is reported to be the fastest in the world.Iran has made great strides in different sectors, including aerospace, nuclear science, medical development, nanotechnology as well as stem cell research and cloning research.This prodigious revolution which shook the ground from under the feet of the tyrants and threatened their existence and interests is not the outcome of a short span of time or the efforts of a limited number of Islamic workers and activists. It is the fruit of generations of Islamic activity, of which one of its great inspiration is the former president Hashemi Rafsanjani who recently passed away.Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani served the Iranian nation until last day of his life.Unfortunately, due to ignorance and stubbornness in the west, the US continues to enact policies aiming at containment and destabilisation of Iran in hopes of effecting eventual regime change.Washington s continuing antagonistic policies towards Iran not only have exposed the sublime folly of Western-style statecraft, but also have managed to destabilise the entire Middle East, thus posing a security threat to Europe and even to the US itself.And guess what? The Islamic State with its Islamic leadership and devotees have survived all this turmoil.A heart and mind free of prejudice and malice has no choice but to salute this Islamic success story.
