LONDON. &#8211; Pep Guardiola claimed English Premier League soccer leaders Chelsea have nothing to fear from Manchester City despite his side s 4-0 demolition of West Ham. Guardiola s team delivered a swaggering display at the London Stadium on Wednesday night as goals from Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva, Gabriel Jesus and Yaya Toure secured City s biggest league win since October.Chelsea manager Antonio Conte was watching from the stands and must have been impressed by City.But City boss Guardiola is adamant the 10-point gap between his fifth-placed team and Chelsea is too much to overcome.Chelsea are also nine points clear of second-placed Tottenham and Guardiola said the Blues will have to choke badly to surrender their grip on the title. He doesn t have to be too worried about what he saw. They are nine points in front. Only Chelsea can lose the Premier League, Guardiola said. When you see how many games they lost in the last 16 games, normally you can expect they won t lose many more. In sport you don t know, but I don t think we can catch them. &#8211; AFP.&nbsp;
