MANCHESTER. &#8211; Jose Mourinho has responded to Ed Woodward s comments that there will not be much churn in the transfer market by Manchester United this summer. The Red Devils executive vice-chairman hinted earlier this week that there would not be a big turnover in players at Old Trafford when the season ends.And Mourinho backed up Woodward s words, saying he is targeting three or four players to add to his squad, rather than six or seven.The Portuguese admits he didn t understand Woodward s turn of phrase, but that his comments were completely right , and he expects a soft, natural transfer window. First of all, yesterday I had to ask a friend about churn because I had no idea, said Mourinho. It s a new word for my vocabulary. You have to learn every time you can, and I thank Ed for that word because I didn t have an idea. He s completely right, of course we speak about it, of course we speak about what next and we know that we have a squad that, like every squad, needs changes, but we know also that our squad has potential, our squad has good players, many of them in the best age, the age of evolution. &#8211; The Mirror.
