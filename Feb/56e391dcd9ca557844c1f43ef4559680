LONDON. Chelsea will make Diego Costa their top-paid player with a 57 million deal.Costa (28) was linked with a big-money move to China throughout the January transfer window. But SunSport understands Costa and his representatives have reached an agreement in principle that will see him sign a five-year deal worth 220 000 a week PLUS bonuses which could send his pay soaring to 65m. And that would leapfrog Cesc Fabregas in the Stamford Bridge salary stakes. The Spanish striker (28) had seemed certain to quit in the summer even after the Blues rejected Chinese club Tianjin Quanjin s 30m-a-year offer. The Sun.
