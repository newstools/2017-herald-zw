JOHANNESBURG. The rand was marginally weaker against the dollar yesterday morning but remained range-bound following a week marred by local political risk. The local currency traded between 13,2336 to the dollar and 13,5269 to the dollar last week despite speculation of a Cabinet reshuffle. There had been rumours that a reshuffle would be announced during President Jacob Zuma s state of the nation address.Zuma s speech focused on radical socioeconomic transformation, but provided little in defining new policy initiatives to bolster the economy and put it on a sustainable economic growth path.Political risk local and international is likely to dominate this week. The budget speech on February 22 will be closely watched as it should reflect the Treasury s commitment to transformation policy while maintaining a path of fiscal consolidation, especially as SA s sovereign credit rating remains at risk of a downgrade.Nedbank analysts said while the rand had attempted to breach the 13,20/$ mark, which held as rand resistance, the more times a level was tested, the greater the probability of breaking through that level.They expect the level to give way to the 12,80/$ horizontal pivot level last seen in June 2015. Local political risks, however, are likely to hinder the rand s attempt to reach those levels.Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen will present the Fed s semi-annual monetary report to the new congress today.
