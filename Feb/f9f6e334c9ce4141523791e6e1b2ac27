Tafadzwa Zimoyo Fashion talk 263 It s two days before Valentine s Day.I suppose, everyone must be busy making plans for the special day. Some are busy looking for last-minute gifts and thinking how to paint the town red. Gone are the days, when some thought of ignoring the day because it is all about love, red and roses.Of all the three, it is either you can have all, or two or one, unless you still in the Singleton lane , but you can still slay.Back to closet business, Valentine s Day is stressful enough, so your outfit should be a no-brainer: wear what makes you feel best.Well if you have not planned yet, then don t waste time, decide and plan now.Once you are done planning, you immediately need to decide about the dress you will wear on the special day.Valentine s day is indeed the most romantic day of the year and your loving partner surely deserves a romantic getaway for this day.Just a quick one, don t go to your usual restaurants since this won t be anything extraordinary and moreover, most restaurants are always overly crowded on this day.Instead, go somewhere where you can both enjoy some peaceful time together and truly bond, this could be done on a long drive or a picnic.Coming towards the dressing, there is no need to go overboard, instead, keep things simple and casual for a fun and romantic day.This, of course is the ideal dressing for the Valentine s day but there are no rules and if you re still going somewhere special and fancy then you need to dress up formally.One important thing that men often tend to ignore are their feet.Whether you re dressing casually or formally, your socks and shoes need to be impressive.Many women tend to make their first impressions about a man through his shoes so make sure that you choose a nice pair of shoes that are truly worthy of being a part of your Valentine s Day.Ladies know best how to dress for Valentine. The challenge is upon us men who somehow treat the day as normal when it comes to fashion.My top picks for this year s Valentine s Day are black crocodile loafers, shoelace-less shoes and brown strappy shoes for men, while as a fashion icon I can pick an LBD or red dress for a lady with less jewellery as accessory.By the way, don t forget to wear your best cologne as nothing turns women on like a nice smelling man does.Lastly, do complement her, give her a nice and thoughtful gift and most importantly, share your feelings with her.Most girls complain how men are not open about their feelings so make this day special for her by being not just a good listener but also a speaker, while at the same time you on point.On the day make sure you need to look like a gentleman.To look best for a movie date wear something that is very trendy and stylish.Wear a branded t-shirt such as Next, Prada and Giordano among others.Do not wear formal clothes for a movie date.Keep it very simple.For more formal or semi-formal look, try wearing royal blue for a sharp look.Blue is a great colour for night time and any man can carry it off like a star.Wearing a blue shirt with a blazer can instantly give you a sharp look.For the swag look, try white thus if you re not in the mood of wearing something dark, or if you feel that light colors look better on you then I suggest that you go for an all white look with a touch of brown and gold.This elegant and yet simple outfit is definitely going to make you stand out.&nbsp;Fashion 101Today, all roads lead to runway, oops!, I mean to Sam Levy s Village for the Dance Fights Cancer , event hosted by Fashion Expo Zimbabwe.The event is aimed to raise funds and create awareness of the cancer scourge to local communities.From 12 pm the programme will start with the village of hope day event, which will be coupled with many activities including fun and games for the whole family, pop up stores, dance competition to mention a few.It will graduate to a fashion show in the evening which will start at 7pm and will finish at 10pm at News Cafe.In an interview with show organiser Raquel Fouche, she said the show is meant to raise funds for cancer patients as well creating awareness campaign.
