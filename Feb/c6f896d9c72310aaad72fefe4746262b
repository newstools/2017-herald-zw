Senior Reporter Paidamoyo Chipunza The Southern African Development Community has warned countries in the region to guard against increased diarrhoeal cases due to incessant rains being experienced in various member States. SADC said in its regional early warning bulletin for the 2016/17 rainy season that the rains have led to surface water stagnation and flooding, thereby increasing the risk of not only waterborne diseases, but also malaria. Flooding due to too much stagnant water increases the chances of water borne diseases such as cholera and other diarrhoeal illnesses, the regional body said. There is also the increase of rodent borne diseases such as plague and vector borne diseases such as malaria. The rains pounding the region have affected many countries, raising fears of disasters like floods and diseases. Zimbabwe has been working on containing a typhoid outbreak which started around the festive season and has so far claimed two lives.Experts say the outbreak was triggered by a sewer burst in Harare s Mbare suburb, leaving close to 200 people being treated of suspected typhoid. National malaria coordinator Dr Joseph Mberikunashe said in an interview that people living in malaria endemic areas should ensure that their homes are sprayed against parasites and that they use treated mosquito nets to protect themselves from getting malaria.He said while most mosquito parasites were being washed away by the rains, concerns were on the ponds of water, which provide conducive environment for mosquito breeding. We are concerned that once the rain stops, these ponds will provide an environment that is conducive for mosquito breeding, which could lead to increased cases of malaria, said Dr Mberikunashe.He said as at December 2016, the burden of malaria nationwide was on the decline, with statistics standing at 17 cases per 1 000. The national malaria programme ran the risk of losing those gains should communities fail to take necessary preventive measures in view of incessant rains, he said.Malaria peak season is usually between April and May when it stops raining.
