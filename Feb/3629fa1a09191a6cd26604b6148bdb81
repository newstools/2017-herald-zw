On February 8, 2017, we published an article titled O-Level results, STEM excites pupils in which the writer quoted former Teachers Union of Zimbabwe chief executive Mr Manuel Nyawo. It has since been established that the Mr Nyawo never commented on the issue. It has also been established that Mr Nyawo is no longer working for TUZ. We would like to apologies to Mr Nyawo for any inconveniences caused. Editor.
