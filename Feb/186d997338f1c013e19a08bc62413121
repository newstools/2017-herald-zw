HAMILTON. A six-wicket haul for Trent Boult and a Ross Taylor century brought New Zealand a 24-run victory over Australia in the third one-day international cricket match yesterday to win the series 2-0. Their masterclass saw New Zealand reclaim the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy while Australia lost their outright hold on the world number one ODI ranking.They slipped to 118 points, equal with South Africa, who beat Sri Lanka in Johannesburg on Saturday to go 3-0 up.South Africa will overtake Australia if they win the remaining two matches in that series.New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson said the series victory was the right response to the tough times when the Black Caps were beaten 3-0 in Australia two months ago, and Taylor paved the way.
