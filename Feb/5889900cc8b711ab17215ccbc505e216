Paidamoyo Chipunza Senior Reporter Government yesterday pleaded with striking doctors to return to work for the sake of patients since some of their grievances have been resolved.The call follows revelations that some doctors heeded their association s call to abscond duty until all their grievances were addressed. The Ministry of Health and Child Care said in a statement last night that there was partial withdrawal of duty at Parirenyatwa and Mpilo hospitals, but investigations by The Herald showed that even at Harare Central Hospital some doctors did not report for duty. We note that there has been partial withdrawal of services by some junior resident medical officers (GMOs) and senior resident medical officers (HMOs) only at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals and Mpilo Central Hospital following indication by the ZHDA that they would, among other things, withdraw services until issues they had put on the table are resolved, the ministry said. Treasury has granted concurrence to 250 posts for GMOs and HMOs, hence posts are available for all doctors, who successfully complete their internship. The ministry is urging all doctors to report for duty for the patients sake in these difficult times. A snap survey by The Herald at central hospitals in Harare Province revealed that only Chitungwiza Central Hospital had its full complement of medical and surgical doctors at work, while other institutions had few doctors available.While patients were being attended to at casualty and emergency departments, there seemed to be no rounds by doctors taking place in the wards.Harare Central Hospital clinical director Mr George Vera said they had to do with the available doctors as they awaited outcomes of engagement between the doctors and Government. The situation was the same at Parirenyatwa Hospital where some doctors heeded the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors (ZHDA) s call to stay away from work.&nbsp;
