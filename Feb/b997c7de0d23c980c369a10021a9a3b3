LONDON. &#8211; Arsenal are growing increasingly anxious that Ars ne Wenger could call time on his managerial career at the club at the end of this soccer season. And Arsenal have drawn up a secret short-list of potential new managers in case Wenger leaves this summer.Wenger, who celebrated 20 years as Arsenal manager last year, again dodged questions about his future ahead of two crucial games for him and the club.But there is a growing concern Wenger could decide to walk away when his current 8 million-a-year contract expires at the end of this season.Sources close to the Frenchman were only a fortnight ago convinced he would sign the two-year extension to his 8 million-a-year contract that has been on the table for some time. But, following back-to-back defeats by Watford and Chelsea, the tone has changed dramatically and there are now real doubts over whether Wenger will stay on.Barring a remarkable turnaround in fortunes, it is now expected Wenger will leave it until the end of the season to make a final decision on his future. That leaves open the very real prospect that Wenger will walk away if Arsenal finish outside the top four or the voices calling for him to go get louder. &#8211; The Mirror.
