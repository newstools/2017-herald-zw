LONDON. &#8211; Paul Pogba s brother is hoping to send the Manchester United midfielder mad and irritable when they meet for the first time as rival professionals in an emotional Europa League tie this week. Florentin Pogba (26), a defender with St Etienne, is determined to pull off a huge upset when the French club face United in the first leg of their Europa League Round of 32 tomorrow night &#8211; and bring out the worst in his younger brother in the process.While Florentin insists Paul &#8211; three years his junior at 23 &#8211; can comfortably handle the pressure of being the world s most expensive footballer, and the relentless scrutiny his 89 million price tag brings, he admits the United player does not cope so well with being beaten. In terms of being the world s most expensive player, I think he has put that to one side because it s more an issue for the media &#8211; he is not letting it bother him, Florentin said. He s just playing his football, even though everything he does gets three or four times more attention, good or bad. He can handle all of that because of the mental strength he has had since his youth. &#8211; Reuters.&nbsp;
