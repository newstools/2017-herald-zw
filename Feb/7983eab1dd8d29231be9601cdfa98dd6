Abdullahi MohamedMOGADISHU. &#8211; Supporters of Somalia s new President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, a veteran diplomat and former prime minister, hope he can be the answer to corruption and extremism in the world s most notorious failed state. The 55-year-old father of four, better known as Farmajo, holds both American and Somali citizenship, and was elected after a six-month voting process marred by widespread allegations of vote-buying and corruption.Nevertheless, Farmajo, from the Darod clan, was welcomed with celebration by many Somalis who had looked forward to change after a series of Hawiye presidents. In a country where clan divisions dominate politics, the administration of his predecessor, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, was widely seen as more corrupt than any that came before him.As president, Farmajo inherits a country where al-Shabaab extremists hold swathes of countryside and attack Mogadishu at will. And after decades of unrest, hundreds of thousands of Somalis have been displaced internally, or else have fled the country. This is the beginning of unity for the Somali nation, the beginning of the fight against Shabaab and corruption, a triumphant Farmajo said after being declared president. Many Somalis fondly remember the eight months when Farmajo &#8211; whose nickname means cheese &#8211; was prime minister in 2010-11.On his Facebook page, Farmajo says that while premier, he implemented the first monthly stipends for soldiers, worked on the country s new constitution and sent delegations to defuse clan-related tensions in several regions. The soldiers firing celebratory gunfire in the streets of Mogadishu on Wednesday have not been paid for months. &#8211; AFP.
