SENIOR Government officials visited Chinatsa Secondary School in Marondera following reports that pupils absconded lessons after a lightning bolt struck and killed two pupils and injured 85. The pupils were at assembly when the incident happened. Pupils were no longer coming to school out of fear and shock. Government has since deployed psychologists to the school to counsel pupils, teachers and parents.A cleansing ceremony by churches and the Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers Association has since been lined up. Our school psychological department together with some social workers from the Ministry of Health and Child Care will continue to talk with the parents and the learners and we hope that as from tomorrow school sessions will start here. &#8211; The Herald.
