MANCHESTER. &#8211; Sergio Aguero watched Gabriel Jesus grab a double on his home debut then dropped a bombshell by casting doubt on his Manchester City future. Real Madrid have a long-standing interest in Aguero who raised the prospect of a summer move after City s 2-1 win over Swansea on Sunday by suggesting his future is unclear and it is up to Manchester City to decide whether he stays at the Etihad. After being named on the bench by Pep Guardiola for the second game running, the 28-year-old Argentina striker said: I have three months to do my best and then we ll see what happens with my future. In three years my contract is up, that s why I say I m happy at the club. In these last three months that are left I have to help the club and, as I say, the club will decide if I have a place here or not. Aguero has been left out on five occasions this season by Guardiola amid suggestions of tensions between them but he insisted he had no problem with being left out. When you re on the bench you have to wait for your opportunity. I have to help the team as much as I can in these three months, afterwards we ll see what the club wants to do with me. - The Daily Express.
