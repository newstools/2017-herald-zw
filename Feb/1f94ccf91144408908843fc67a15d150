LONDON. &#8211; How Arsenal respond to recent setbacks will go a long way in deciding their season, according to manager Arsene Wenger.The Gunners head into today s lunchtime s English Premier League soccer clash with struggling Hull City at the Emirates on the back of successive top-flight defeats to Chelsea and Watford. Those reverses have seen Wenger s side slip to fourth in the table, 12 points behind leaders Chelsea, making the Tigers visit to the capital this weekend a match of vital importance.With fixtures against Bayern Munich in the Champions League last 16 and non-league Sutton United in the FA Cup fifth round to immediately follow, Wenger has described the next three games as the decisive part of Arsenal s season. We come out of two disappointing results after a very difficult week, said Wenger in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports. So what I mean when I say that is the way that we respond in a united way to a difficult moment in the season. It is a very sensitive moment because we come out of a big disappointment. But as well we have massive challenges in front of us, we play Hull first at home, then we have the Champions League at stake, then we have the FA Cup at stake. It is an interesting point of the season as well because it is how you respond to that that will decide our season. Assessing last Saturday s 3-1 loss to rivals Chelsea, Wenger feels that despite the mistakes his players made at Stamford Bridge, the match was an even contest. &#8211; Sky Sports.
