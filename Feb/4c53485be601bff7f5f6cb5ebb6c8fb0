LONDON. Rafa Benitez is the shock name in the frame for the Arsenal job. The Newcastle manager is in the frame to take over if the Arsenal chief decides to call it a day at the end of this season. And the Spaniard will ask Gunners legend Thierry Henry to join him on the coaching staff. Benitez is one of four names that have been identified by the Arsenal hierarchy as suitable for the job.The move would be a huge blow for Newcastle where Benitez has led the Magpies charge back to the English Premier League.The 56-year-old is adored in the north-east, but the lure of taking over one of the most influential clubs in England would be sure to appeal.However, Benitez will have competition for the post with Borussia Dortmund s Thomas Tuchel having been installed as among the favourites.Luis Enrique at Barcelona is another while Monaco s Leonardo Jardim remains an outsider.Henry, has already been cutting his teeth in management working alongside Roberto Martinez with Belgium.Wenger has been in charge of the north London club for 21 years, but there is now a definite split among fans over whether he should remain or leave.The club s wait for a Premier League title stands at 12 years, and barring a remarkable set of events unfolding across London and Manchester, that will soon be 13.A new two-year deal has been in the offing for the Frenchman to extend his stay at the Emirates, but with that remaining unsigned the Gunners are making contingency plans.
