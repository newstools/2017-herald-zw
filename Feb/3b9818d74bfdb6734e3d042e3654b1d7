This year we were not lucky and the top continental prizes have gone to other countries, but we know that judges were delighted with the quantity and quality of entries from Zimbabwe and we look forward to continued entyry by Zimbabwean high school students when the 2017 competition takes place towards the end of this year, she said.In 2010 MultiChoice Africa and Eutelsat combined their expertise to initiate an annual pan-African student competition called the DStv Eutelsat Star Awards, which is aimed at encouraging 14 to 19-year-old students to write an essay or design a poster on a satellite-related topic.Country winners are named in each category and they then compete with colleagues from across Africa for the overall awards.Country winners for Zimbabwe this time were: Andile Dube (18), of St Columba s High School, Bulawayo who won the essay section, with runner-up being 16-year-old Ruvimbo Jongwe, of St Dominic s High School in Chishawasha .In the poster category, Shaun Matondo (16) of Hartzell High School in Mutare was named winner, and the runner-up is 17-year-old Brandon Murira of Mutare Boys High School.
