MANCHESTER. &#8211; Michael Carrick insists no one at Manchester United will be celebrating if they secure a top-four finish this season.Winning is still all that matters at United, even if their last English Premier League soccer title triumph came four years ago in Sir Alex Ferguson s farewell season. For midfielder Carrick , a five-time title-winner with the Old Trafford giants, the frustration at not adding to that haul will not be soothed by the consolation prize of a Champions League spot. It s not something we d celebrate, if we finished third, fourth or even second, said the 35-year-old. You only celebrate when you win, but the Champions League is a big part of this club. It s where you want to play, it s where the best players want to play, So in terms of attracting players and all that type of stuff, the club is geared up for that, of course it is, but you can only celebrate winning, really, and finishing top. United, currently sixth, have missed out on the top four in two of the three seasons since Sir Alex Ferguson left and there is no guarantee they will make it back there this year, a point acknowledged by Carrick. &#8211; The Daily Mirror.
