Some of Finest Clothing s designsVongai Mbara:Arts ReporterTwo Dzivarasekwa designers have raised the Zimbabwean flag high after their clothing line crossed national borders. Early last year, Richard Icey Maposa and Pritchard Blakes Marufu started their brand DZ s Finest whose market was targeted at Dzivarasekwa residents. The brand however, managed to attract many people from different parts of the world which led them to rename their brand Finest Clothing Company . We are proudly from DZ and that is why we had branded ourselves as DZ s Finest but we had to re-brand because we have a vision of moving our Finest brand from the local market up to the international market. Dz s Finest could not cater for all that but Finest Clothing Company will so. For example, we now have Bindura s Finest under our Finest brand, said Richard.Finest Clothing Line consists of a range of clothing items from T-shirts, caps, bottoms, sweaters and jeans. We are going to cover other ghettos and suburbs like Fio s Finest, Mbare s Finest and internationally we are looking at Zim s Finest and Africa s Finest coming in this year. We are at the final stages of these projects. Our designs are now being worn by people from different countries such as South Africa, Australia, Canada, said Pritchard.Their brand gained its market through their social media platform Finest Clothing Line where they advertise.Growing up in the ghetto and seeing a lot of youths take wrong paths in life has motivated these two to chase their dreams and make it a reality. Some dreams come true and some do not but we had a vision. Growing up in the ghetto will always be an inspiration to us every day because it pushes us to be who we want to be, so basically our dreams pushed us to make it a reality, said Richard.
