Proverbs 22 vs 1 A good name is more desirable than great riches; to be esteemed is better than silver or gold. Today, I spent some time reminiscing on the people we have lost from the beginning of the year to date.As I did, I was taken aback by the diversity of the ages that make up the list.People of all ages have left us this year: young and old, some at the start of their lives, some in the middle and others right at the end.At whatever stage they may have been, one thing that is constant is that, at the appointed time they departed from this world.We all make grand plans of where we want to go and how we intend to get there and, in the process we tend to hurt, injure and maim other people, all in a bid to get ahead.Look back at your own life; how many people have you hurt in your quest for growth and advancement?We do not know what tomorrow holds for us, only God knows the plans He has for each one of us.Therefore, as we make our plans and plot our path for growth may we be guided by the knowledge that the name we carry today, that we are going to leave behind, is more important than the sum total of everything we can seek to acquire.May our desire to follow His ways help us to always do the right thing, while we still have the opportunity to do so.Be blessed.For More Info: Visit our website: www.thefig-tree.orgEmail us on [email&#160;protected]Catch us on StarFM, Monday to Friday at 0620hours
