Psalm 27 vs 13-14; I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord. Patience is one of the hardest disciplines to master. It s not easy to just sit still and wait for things that you think must happen now.At some point, we have all experienced varying levels of anxiety and unhappiness, because of our inability to wait a minute longer for the things we yearn for.Today, you could be one of many people who are wallowing in the pain of expectations that have not yet been met. You have cursed, screamed, cried and even reached a point where you think your life has literally come to an end.Wait patiently for your breakthrough and be strengthened by the knowledge that God is never late in His response. Though you may be filled with doubt, rest assured that He is listening and He is gradually answering your prayers.Your answer will certainly come at His appointed time and when you look back, you will realise that the time you spent waiting taught you lessons that will hold you in good stead for the assignment He has for you. Today s experiences are lessons for tomorrow. Be patient in prayer.Be blessed.REFLECTIONS OF A WORK IN PROGRESS . . .For more info: Visit our website: www.thefig-tree.org; e-mail us on [email&#160;protected]; catch us on StarFM, Monday to Friday at 0620hours.
