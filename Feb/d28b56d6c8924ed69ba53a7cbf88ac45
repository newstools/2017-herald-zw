BOURNEMOUTH. &#8211; Pep Guardiola admits Manchester City will need a perfect finish to the season to reel in Chelsea and win the English Premier League soccer title. Guardiola says Manchester City are too far behind Chelsea to catch the Premier League leaders, despite moving up to second by beating Bournemouth on Monday night.City recorded a 2-0 win at the Vitality Stadium thanks to Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero to reduce the gap on the Blues, who could only manage a 1-1 draw at Burnley on Sunday, to eight points with 13 games remaining.However, Guardiola says he does not except Antonio Conte s side to slip up in the race for the title. The gap is still so long, so you do not expect them (Chelsea) to lose games and it is so, so difficult to win all the games, he told Sky Sports.And he insisted Aguero remains important to City s hopes after he came off the bench to replace the injured Gabriel Jesus and helped them climb up to second after Monday night s 2-0 victory over Bournemouth.Sub Aguero claimed City s clincher at Bournemouth after Raheem Sterling s opener as Guardiola s men cut Chelsea s lead to eight points. Guardiola said: It s so difficult to catch Chelsea. They have to lose three games, and we have to win all our games. &#8211; The Mirror.&nbsp;
