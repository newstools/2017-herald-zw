Mr ChidemeTalent Hwari Herald Reporter Most Harare suburbs will be without water this weekend, as the Harare City Council is carrying out yet another maintenance of Morton Jaffray Water Treatment Plant. The city has been shutting down the water treatment plant, especially on weekends, for some time while carrying out the maintenance works.This has irked residents, who are now raising questions on why the council is taking so long to overhaul its water supply system after the maintenance works started in 2013.The regular shutdown of Morton Jaffray plant has also raised fears of water-borne diseases, as some people tend to rely on unprotected sources of water.Harare city acting spokesperson Mr Michael Chideme said the Morton Jaffray plant was being shut down to enable emergency maintenance work at Warren Control pump station. The City of Harare wishes to advise residents that there will be partial shutdown of the Morton Jaffray Water Treatment Plant from Friday, 10 February at 6pm to Saturday, 11 February at 8pm, he said.The shutdown will affect low density suburbs, the central business district, Highfield, Mbare, Mabvuku and Tafara.
