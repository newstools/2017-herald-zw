Hollywood directors named Damien Chazelle the best film director of 2016 for La La Land at a gala ceremony on Saturday, placing the musical in a strong position for the movie world s top honours, the Oscars, later this month. The Directors Guild of America (DGA), the leading industry group representing film and television directors, chose Ezra Edelman as the best documentary maker for OJ: Made in America which is nominated for the best documentary feature Oscar.Past DGA feature film award winners have often gone on to claim the best director Oscar and see their films win best picture from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.Australian director Garth Davis won the first-time feature DGA honor for the drama Lion .It was Chazelle s first DGAwin and first nomination foronly his third feature film, which scored a record-tying 14 Oscar nominations last month, including best picture and best director for Chazelle.So far this year industry awards from the Producers Guild and now the DGA have gone to La La Land , a musical set in Los Angeles starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone which now appears to be the odds-on Oscars favourite.The Oscars will be handed out in Hollywood on February 26 to producers, directors, actors and actresses in a star-studded television show viewed around the world and among the most-watched TV programs in the United States.As with other recent award shows such as the Golden Globes, some at the gala addressed recent political events, including policies enacted by President Donald Trump in areas such as immigration which have fomented protests.
