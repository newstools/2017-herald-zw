They also entered into contractual agreements with other companies.The court heard that the company, which had no property at the time of Chari s arrest, now has five motor vehicles, computers, a stand (No. 127 A, Seke Road) and several branches.As a result of the misrepresentation, the complainant suffered prejudice in the reputation and good administration of his company and financial prejudice in the sum of $497 040 and nothing was recovered.Meanwhile, a second pair who allegedly claimed that they owned Caledonia Farm and allocated stands to desperate home seekers, prejudicing them of about $56 million will stand trial at the High Court.Yasin Alfred (44) and Shingirayi Pfirwe yesterday appeared before Harare magistrate Ms Rumbidzai Mugwagwa.Ms Mugwagwa said the accused were not yet given their trial date despite being on remand since September last year.
