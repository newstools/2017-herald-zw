LONDON. Henrikh Mkhitaryan has hit back at critics who suggested he moved to Manchester United for financial reasons. Mkhitaryan switched to Old Trafford for 26.3m in a deal that Dortmund described as incredibly lucrative , with reports in Germany suggesting the Armenian was to treble his salary and bank a substantial signing-on bonus. But the 28-year-old has baulked at suggestions he headed to England for money &#8211; and hit back at previous criticism from Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. I can t understand it &#8211; it s wrong, he told SportBild. If it was only about money for me, I would have moved from Shakhtar Donetsk to Anzhi Makhachkala and not to Borussia Dortmund. But I didn t want that. I wanted to develop myself further. Watzke described Mkhitaryan s Manchester move as odd and had told German media he was disappointed that the Armenia international had not taken a penalty against Bayern Munich in last season s German Cup final, which Dortmund lost in a shoot-out.But Mkhitaryan said: If he wants to assess me on the basis of one game, that s wrong. He s probably forgotten what I did the whole season before. I would have scored a penalty in Berlin. But there s a coach and 11 players on the pitch and we discussed who would take one. Mkhitaryan has starred for Jose Mourinho s side in recent weeks after a prolonged spell watching on from the sidelines and admitted he was pleased to see former Bundesliga rival Bastian Schweinsteiger given an apparent reprieve.
