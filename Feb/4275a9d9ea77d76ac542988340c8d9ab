Sports Reporter&#8212;HOCKEY Association of Zimbabwe president Grant Campbell has noted that development is one of the key areas they are focusing on this year.With most of their activities expected to start in April, Campbell said they are looking forward to the upcoming season and are working with schools as they seek to take development of the sport to another level. The national association also have the 2018 Youth Olympic Games to prepare for. This year development is key, so we are working with schools, we are meeting with schools bodies on that. We are preparing the Under-17s for the junior Olympics, that s part of our preparations for this year. We definitely know its coming, that s why it s key to start preparation for our boys and girls. We have some indoor competition which is later on in the year, said Campbell.He said they have engaged South Africa to see if there are any tournaments local schools can compete in. We are waiting for feedback from South Africa because normally they have some tournaments. If by our next meeting we have not had feedback, we will try and go ahead with a tournament in Zimbabwe for the Under-16 and Under-18, said Campbell. In 2015, the national association organised matches for the Under-16 and Under-18 girls featuring Zambia as part of their effort to develop local teams. Two years ago we did hold a tournament for girls, we had teams that came from Zambia. That was a success. Our plan is we would like to invite South Africa, Zambia, Namibia, we are trying Botswana . . . but obviously it s still in infancy stage, said Campbell.
