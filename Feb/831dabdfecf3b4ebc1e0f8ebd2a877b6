LONDON. Joe Root has been named as new Test captain of England, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced yesterday. Yorkshire batsman Root, previously England s vice-captain, had been the overwhelming favourite to replace Alastair Cook ever since the Essex opener resigned as Test skipper after a national record 59 matches in charge last week. Root, who made his England debut under Cook, is now widely regarded as England s leading batsman. It is a huge honour to be given the England Test captaincy, the 26-year-old Root said in an ECB statement. I feel privileged, humbled and very excited. The ECB added all-rounder Ben Stokes would succeed Root as vice-captain of the Test side.Cook, England s all-time leading Test run-scorer, is set to continue his career in the five-day game, with Root also able to call upon the experience of senior fast bowlers James Anderson and Stuart Broad, as well as coach Trevor Bayliss and Paul Farbrace.
