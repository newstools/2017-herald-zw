LONDON. Arsene Wenger has admitted for the first time that Mesut Ozil is struggling. Ozil is suffering from a lack of confidence after failing to score in eight straight games, Wenger has admitted. The German star has cut a frustrated figure in recent weeks, struggling to make an impact for the Gunners who have slipped 10 points adrift of Chelsea. Ozil (28) has not scored for the north London side since December and Wenger admits he is concerned by his form.After his uninspiring display in Arsenal s 3-1 defeat of Chelsea a week earlier, the supposed Wizard of Oz failed to cast his spell on Hull either.He fluffed a great volley chance in the first half, then miscontrolled when he could have gone clean through in the second, with an exasperated Wenger turning in disbelief to his assistant Boro Primorac.It s a massive week for under-fire Arsenal boss Wenger as he takes his team to face Bayern Munich in the Champions League tomorrow.
