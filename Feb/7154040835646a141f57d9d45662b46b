 tienne TshisekediKINSHASA. &#8211; Plans to bring home the body of long-time Congolese opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi and give him a grand national funeral appear to have run aground, mired in a rumpus between his friends and foes. Almost 10 days after his death at 84 in Brussels, there was no sign Thursday of his coffin s imminent return to Democratic Republic of Congo as had been hoped.Last weekend, thousands of tearful members of Europe s Congolese diaspora turned out in Brussels to pay their last respects to Tshisekedi, who had a three-day funeral wake, his casket on display in a large hall made available by city authorities. &#8211; AFP.
