The letter thanked President Xi for his congratulatory note on Trump s inauguration and wished the Chinese people a prosperous Lunar New Year of the Rooster, the White House said in a statement on Wednesday. President Trump stated that he looks forward to working with President Xi to develop a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China, it said. China said yesterday it attached great importance to China-US ties. We highly appreciate President Trump s holiday greetings to President Xi Jinping and the Chinese people, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said at a daily Press briefing.Asked whether it was a snub that Trump had held calls with many other world leaders as president, but not president Xi, Lu said: This kind of remark is meaningless. He reiterated that China and the US had maintained close communication since Trump took office and that cooperation was the only correct choice . China is willing to work with the United States in adhering to the principles of non-confrontation, mutual respect and mutual benefit to promote cooperation, control disputes, and on a healthy and stable foundation, promote greater development in China-US ties, Lu said.Presidents Trump and Xi have yet to speak directly since Trump took office on January 20, although they did talk soon after Trump won the US presidential election in November. &#8211; Reuters.
