MANCHESTER. Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho does not believe Chelsea will slip up in the title race as his side kept up pace with the top of the English Premier League. United s 2-0 win over Watford at Old Trafford on Saturday, thanks to goals from Juan Mata and Anthony Martial, means they are now a point off the top four places, and 11 points off leaders Chelsea.Chelsea played at Burnley yesterday, and with 14 games remaining, the former Blues boss says he does not believe anyone will catch them. Mourinho told Sky Sports when asked if United themselves can catch Chelsea: Honestly I don t think so. Why? Because Chelsea are a very good defensive team, they defend very well and defend with lots of players, very good players, and are very well organised. I think in this situation, a very defensive team wins the title with counter-attack goals, set pieces goals, and individual goals from talented players. So I don t think they re going to let it slip. But football is football, you never know. Regarding his own side s performance at Old Trafford, Mourinho said it was a must-win game, particularly with Liverpool beating Tottenham on Saturday night, meaning one team had to drop points.He said: We needed to win. It was a dangerous game, they are a good team with good and experienced players. They came obviously to defend but when they were losing they tried and were dangerous. It was a difficult match and it s an important win. We create a lot of chances but don t score a lot of goals. I m really happy with the performance, I think in the first half we had periods when we were really brilliant. We were organised and defensively worked well so I m pleased with the clean sheet. United had 23 attempts on goal in a fine attacking display, and Mourinho admitted the period of chances before Mata s opening goal was astonishing . The period before the first goal, was almost I say astonishing, Mourinho said. Sky Sports
