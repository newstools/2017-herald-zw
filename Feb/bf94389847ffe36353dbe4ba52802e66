Tinashe Makichi Business Reporter Japanese contractor Konoike Construction has started the development of Nyakomba Irrigation Scheme in Nyanga following a $15 million commitment by Japan towards the project. Nyakomba Irrigation Scheme, which encompasses Blocks B, C and D that measure up to 430 hectares, was established with the assistance of Japan in 1997.The facility was then damaged by Cyclone Eline in 2000, resulting in the scheme being subdivided into 0,8ha per plot holder.However, following the injection of some funds, Japan through Japan International Cooperation Agency is now working towards re-development of the project.In a progress report seen by The Herald Business yesterday, Konoike Construction has already started preliminary works on development of the irrigation project. So far the contractor has been registered with the local companies registry of the Republic of Zimbabwe. There shall be a joint inspection within the contractors team and Masimba Base camp continues in mobilisation. The sub-contractor (Masimba) will source goods that would need a lead time from suppliers to avoid delays, said Konoike Construction in the report.Nyakomba Irrigation Scheme, among other things, will focus on the construction of irrigation facilities in Block A which covers 138 ha for A1 and A2 farmers.The project is focusing on the construction of irrigation facilities, replacement and repairing of pump and flood protection structure for existing irrigation facilities which were damaged by floods in 2000.The initiative will also look at procurement of pumps, pipelines and other equipment needed for operation and maintenance required in block A, B, C and D.The Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development which is the client has already liaised with ZESA Holdings for the separation of power meters for the existing offices. The client is liaising with ZESA Holdings for the separation of power meters for the client offices, said Konoike ConstructionThe repair of existing irrigation infrastructure at Nyakomba Irrigation Scheme is expected to drastically reduce the adverse impact of climate change and improve household food security among impoverished small-holder farmers.The partnership between Government and JICA is key in enhancing sustainable agriculture and development, given that Zimbabwe s agriculture had remained heavily reliant on rains and only to suffer from severe weather vagaries.The Nyakomba Irrigation Scheme has already benefited many families in the community through poverty alleviation and food production through the production of maize, beans and Tabasco chilli.Although the scheme has almost achieved its target, many problems are being encountered. Effective scheme operation and maintenance as well as production support services have been adversely affected by weak management and inadequate operating budgets.This has often resulted in farmers reverting to their traditionally diverse activities, eventually leading to neglect of irrigated areas and low production.&nbsp;
