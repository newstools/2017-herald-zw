Crime ReporterPolice have expressed concern over an increase in white-collar crime and urged members of the public to be wary of fraudsters. This comes after police have been receiving many such cases since last year, with some of the suspects getting arrested while others are still at large. Criminal Investigations Department (CID) spokesperson Detective Assistant Inspector Portia Chinho said more cases of that nature were being reported. She said the CID recently launched a manhunt for three suspected serial fraudsters, who defrauded companies and individuals of over $400 000.Three suspects, who are on their most wanted list, are Tonderai Muocha of Epworth, Israel Tangwena of Hatfield and Andrew Chikuni of Chitungwiza.Det Asst Insp Chinho said Muocha and Tangwena, who were employed as operations director and managing director respectively by Hedgehold Trading (Pvt) Ltd, were wanted for fraud involving $350 000. During the period extending from July 2013 to July 2014, the suspects approached a complainant for funding of a new company on condition that he was going to be incorporated into the shareholding and directorship of the company, she said. The complainant obtained a loan amounting to $350 000 from two banks, to which he offered his two houses as surety. The accused persons then issued the complainant with documents which included him as one of the directors of the company. Det Asst Insp Chinho said the two suspects later terminated the agreement after a misunderstanding with the complainant and fraudulently replaced him.The complainant lost $350 000 as a result of the misrepresentation and Muocha and Tangwena have since gone into hiding. Det Asst Insp Chinho said Chikuni (37) is wanted in a fraud case involving $55 435,80 after fleecing Ranwa Marketing (Pvt) in Harare.&nbsp;
