Farai JerePaul Mundandi Sports Reporter CAPS United president Farai Jere is very optimistic the Green Machine will roll past Lesotho side Lioli on Sunday in a CAF Champions League preliminary round, second leg tie at the National Sports Stadium. The Harare businessman watched his side grind out a goalless draw in the first leg in Maseru and a win on Sunday will see them booking a showdown against continental giants TP Mazembe. I believe in my boys and I am happy that they managed to get a draw away. We are a bigger club than Lioli and I am confident that my boys will rise to the occasion and put smiles on the faces of Makepekepe family and the majority of Zimbabweans, said Jere, who joined his men at their training session yesterday. Our target has always been playing in the Champions League group stage and it has never changed. I still believe we can make it and, as always, we believe that God will see us through. He has been with us and he will always be with us. I am looking ahead and all I need to do is start preparing for the trip to DRC as I am pretty sure that Lioli will not stand in our way. Liolo were impressed by CAPS United goalminder Edmore Sibanda, Hardlife Zvirekwi, Denis Dauda and Tafadzwa Rusike.Rusike might have played for less than a quarter-of-an-hour, but he made some good touches.Joel Josta Ngodzo and Kudzi Nyamupfukudza had the agony of watching the match from the sidelines because of registration irregularities.They have since been cleared to play on Sunday.Makepekepe have turned the National Sports Stadium into their fortress where they didn t lose a single league match all season last year. The Green Machine even refused to be overwhelmed by a three-goal deficit, in the Harare Derby, with just five minutes left in the game.Dauda scored a brace as Makepekepe roared back to force a share of the points.
