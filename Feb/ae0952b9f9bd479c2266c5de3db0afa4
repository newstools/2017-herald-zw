This session follows a similar one held in Harare in September 2015.The Seminar, to be held on February 15, will raise awareness on the rules and requirements for exporting to Sweden as well as to the European Union (EU).Open Trade Gate Sweden will also provide requisite market intelligence to Zimbabwean companies, particularly those with the potential as well as the capacity to export to Sweden and the EU. Some of the areas to be covered in detail include export procedures, trade agreements, as well as Swedish imports and consumer demands.According to Trademap, in 2015, Sweden imported $4,4 billion of clothing &amp; textiles and $4,3 billion worth of leather products globally. Zimbabwe s exports of clothing and textiles to Sweden during the period under review stood at $15 000. This, therefore, presents a huge opportunity for local players hence the need for this session.OTGS is a one-stop information centre that was set up by the Swedish Government as a public service to exporters from developing countries. It is mandated to facilitate trade and increase exports from developing countries to Sweden.
