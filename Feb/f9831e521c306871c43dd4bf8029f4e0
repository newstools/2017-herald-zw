MADRID. Real Madrid hope to have Luka Modric and Marcelo back fit as they seek to exact revenge for their recent Copa del Rey elimination at the hands of Celta Vigo when they return to Balaidos tomorrow. Celta weathered a second-leg storm at home after pulling off a surprise 2-1 first-leg win at the Santiago Bernabeu to progress to the last four 4-3 on aggregate just over a week ago.However, the roles from the second leg of that tie look set to be reversed as a far stronger Real side travels north with Celta boss Eduardo Berizzo set to make a series of changes with his side s Cup semi-final, second leg away at Alaves on Wednesday in mind.Modric and Marcelo have missed the last two games through injury, but both returned to training on Thursday and could feature. The presence of Modric in midfield would be doubly important to Zinedine Zidane s men with Toni Kroos suspended.Berizzo has heavily rotated his Celta side in their past two La Liga outings to prioritise the Cup. And with the Galicians just 90 minutes away from a first Cup final since 2001 with the tie against Alaves delicately poised at 0-0, the Argentine expected to do so again with the likes of top scorer Iago Aspas dropping to the bench.Fixures Today: Malaga v Espanyol (2pm), Barcelona v Athletic Bilbao (5:15pm), Atletico Madrid v Leganes (7:30pm), Valencia v Eibar (9:45pm)Tomorrow: Sevilla v Villarreal (1pm), Sporting Gijon v Alaves (5:15pm), Real Sociedad v Osasuna (7:30pm), Celta Vigo v Real Madrid (9:45pm)Monday: Granada v Las Palmas (9:45pm).
