Paul Mundandi:Sports ReporterPREMIERSHIP soccer side Triangle United have set their sights on ZIFA technical director Taurai Mangwiro. After ending their one-year marriage with David Yogi Mandigora last year, Triangle are still hunting for a new coach. Triangle tried in vain this week to lure Sunday Mhofu Chidzambwa, but the country s most decorated coach, who penned a new one-year deal with ZPC Kariba on January 4, turned them down.Yesterday Ronald Mudimu and Lameck Nhamo were in charge of the pre-season training at Gibbo. The Lowveld side are now targeting Mangwiro and former Highlanders coach Bongani Mafu to guide them. During the off-season a lot of things do happen, including a lot of gossip. I am a coach and our job is being in the dugout, said Mangwiro. I have a three-year contract with ZIFA and if they want me they have to go through the proper channels. I can, however, go and coach and I will not rule this out. As a coach you yearn to win trophies and the league title and I am not an exception. Even in Zambia the technical director left his job and is now in charge of Red Arrows. Zambian Tennant Chilumba, who was among their prime targets, wants to stay in his homeland. Mohammed Fathy had also been linked to the Triangle job, but has renewed his contract in Zambia. I wanted to come and coach Triangle. They got hold of me but they took long to table their offer and I am a football person. I waited but was given another offer here and I did not hesitate, said Fathy.
