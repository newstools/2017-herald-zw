ZIMBABWE will be out to get their campaign at the ICC Women s World Cup Qualifier 2017 off to a good start when they play Ireland today in their first group match in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Coached by Trevor Phiri, Zimbabwe made their intentions at the 10-team tournament clear by romping to a convincing 95-run win over Scotland in a warm-up match on Sunday.After being asked to bat first at Colombo Cricket Club, Zimbabwe ran up a total of 197 for nine in 50 overs, with Pellagia Mujaji top-scoring with 39, while Loreen Tshuma chipped in with a valuable 32.Tasmeen Granger then starred with the ball, taking two wickets for 23 runs off the nine overs she bowled. She also effected two run-outs. Anesu Mushangwe also bowled superbly as she grabbed two wickets for two runs off her two overs.Nomatter Mutasa, Esther Mbofana and Tshuma all took a wicket each as Zimbabwe bowled out Scotland for 102 to seal the win.Despite that morale-boosting victory, Phiri s charges know too well the real job starts tomorrow and will therefore have to guard against complacency. This tournament is very big for us. We have to do well and put Zimbabwe women s cricket back on the map. We do well and more women s cricket will be played back home, Zimbabwe captain Sharne Mayers said on the eve of the first round.
