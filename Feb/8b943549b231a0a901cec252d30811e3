Anesu Chakabva Herald Reporter&#8212;A 33-year-old Chinamhora man appeared before Harare magistrate facing charges of assault and malicious damage to property after he allegedly assaulted a sex worker and set her property on fire. Mr Hosea Mujaya remanded James Soroti out of custody to February 16 on $50 bail.The accused used to pay Pedzisai Zhuwawo (30) for sex on several occasions before the incident.The court heard that on January 28 this year, Soroti went into Zhuwawo s room at Musoma Booking Houses at Zimbiru Business Centre in Chinamhora where the two had agreed to meet.It is alleged that when Soroti arrived, Zhuwawo s boyfriend called her to go and show him her sister s house but she told the boyfriend that she had a client.However, Zhuwawo later met her boyfriend and took longer than expected which angered Soroti who then went out of the room, locked the door and kept the keys.Upon return, Zhuwawo demanded the keys back from Soroti who said he had given them to Zhuwawo s friend Norah Katsande.After Katsande denied being in possession of the keys in question, Zhuwawo confronted Soroti and a misunderstanding arose. He slapped her once and went on to assault her with a stone on the back of the head resulting in Zhuwawo s fall.Katsande called Taurai Mawango, Zhuwawo s boyfriend to come and rescue her while Soroti fled the scene.The court heard that after Zhuwawo regained consciousness, she was taken to hospital and later put up at her sister s house.Soroti allegedly went back to her house, set her property ablaze and locked the door.The fire was put out by neighbours who noticed the smoke coming out of Zhuwawo s room and nothing was recovered.
