Bengaluru Gold slipped yesterday as the dollar strengthened against the yen, with the greenback buoyed by a smooth meeting between US President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that saw no mention of currency policy. Spot gold shed 0,3 percent, to $1 229,77 per ounce at 3.20am GMT, while US gold futures fell 0,4 percent, to $1 231. The dollar index was up 0,16 percent to 100,960, with the greenback rising against the yen on relief that Trump set aside his tough campaign rhetoric over security and jobs in a meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister over the weekend. Quietness on the protectionism front and a rekindling of the Trumpflation trade is taking the wind out of gold s safe-haven sails, said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda.A senior Japanese government spokesman said Abe and Trump did not discuss currency issues and that Trump did not request a bilateral trade deal. The dollar had suffered its worst January in three decades after Trump complained that every other country lives on devaluation .The US currency also found broad support from comments by Trump on Thursday that he planned to announce an ambitious tax reform plan in the next few weeks, rekindling the hope for big tax cuts.
