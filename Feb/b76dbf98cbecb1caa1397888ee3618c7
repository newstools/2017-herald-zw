FOUR fine individual performances for Zimbabwe A stood out above the indifferent bowling and fragile top-order batting that were responsible for home side s third successive defeat at the hands of the rampant Afghanistan A team, this time by 20 runs, at Harare Sports Club yesterday. Pride of place goes to Innocent Kaia, whose magnificent innings came through another disastrous top-order collapse by the Zimbabwe A batsmen and Ryan Burl, who played another excellent innings in support.Tendai Chatara began the match with a superb opening spell that removed the Afghan openers for just a single run between them, while Nathan Waller bowled a very tight 10-over spell that his teammates were unable to copy, and almost brought off an incredible victory at the death.But the bottom line was another defeat for Zimbabwe A and the five-match series to Afghanistan A.There was heavy rain overnight and conditions were still very damp, although the sun was shining,when Zimbabwe A won the toss and took what appeared to be the wise decision in these circumstances in putting the tourists in to bat, as long as the weather had no more serious shocks in store.Zimbabwe A fielded an unchanged team in this match, despite the dismal performance of most of their leading batsmen thus far in the series.Chatara found the conditions to his liking in his first over, beating the bat a couple of times with movement on the pitch.Off the fifth ball the Afghans new opening batsman Karim Sadiq took what appeared to be a desperate swing at the ball and edged a catch to the keeper Ryan Murray, without a run on the board the only contact bat made with ball during that first over. Chatara continued to relish the conditions, as he struck again in his second over, removing Nasir Khan (1), who edged his defensive stroke to the keeper; three for two wickets. Although the batsmen were fairly comfortable with Neville Madziva, they continued to find it hard to get a full bat on to Chatara s deliveries, and he did not concede a run until the final ball of his fourth over, when Younas Ahmadzai slashed a thick edge through point for four.The Afghans scored only 20 runs off the first 11 overs, but when Carl Mumba replaced Madziva, the runs began to flow and 13 runs came off his second over, 12 of them to Ahmadzai, while Waheedullah Shafaq played a quiet role.Chatara finished his superb opening spell with figures of six overs, three maidens, eight runs for two wickets.The team s 50 came up in the 17th over, 34 of them to Ahmadzai and the pitch was beginning to flatten out now under the warm sun. While Shafaq grew more confident, Ahmadzai did become rather bogged now, although reaching his 50 off 69 balls.Immediately afterwards, Shafaq pulled a short ball from Waller straight at midwicket and departed for 42, the total now being 95 for three after 27 overs.The team s century duly followed after 29 overs, with Khaibar Omar now at the crease.Waller bowled his 10 overs without a break, returning the economical figures of one for 36. The batsmen gradually went on the attack and after 40 overs, the score was 162 for three, a good launching pad for an all-out assault during the final 10.The Afghan batsmen were particularly strong on the pull when the bowlers pitched too short, and hit some big sixes from that stroke. Ahmadzai reached his century off 112 balls, a fine innings, coming in as he did with the two openers out for one run between them. He reached 104 and was then bowled by Madziva, returning for his final spell, as he went for a big hit; the partnership with Omar had put on 99 runs and the score as 194 for four in the 45th over.ScoresAfghanistan A 279 for 4 in 50 overs (Younas Ahmadzai 104, Shafiqullah 70*, Khaibar Omar 54*; Tendai Chatara 2/52, Nathan Waller 1/36)Zimbabwe A 259 for 9 in 50 overs (Innocent Kaia 100, Ryan Burl 70; Nawaz Khan 5/51, Mohammad Ibrahim 2/38).
