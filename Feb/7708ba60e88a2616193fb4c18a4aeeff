BOURNEMOUTH. Manchester City forward Gabriel Jesus aims to extend his dazzling start to life in the English Premier League with another inspired display at Bournemouth tonight. Pep Guardiola s team dropped out of the Champions League soccer qualification places after losing four of the nine top-flight matches they played during December and January. Three successive wins across two competitions have brightened the mood however, with Jesus making significant contributions in each match.The Brazil striker, whose move from Palmeiras was completed during the mid-season transfer window, has scored three times in two English Premier League starts, and got both goals as Swansea were defeated 2-1 at Eastlands last Sunday.In the last few days, team-mates Fernandinho and Yaya Toure have both warned against getting too carried away with the 19-year-old s excellent start, yet some pundits have asked if this might be the beginning of the end for Sergio Aguero at City.Aguero has made only brief substitute appearances in each of the club s last two matches, and suggested after the Swansea match that he was unsure about his future, although City moved swiftly to indicate that they had no plans to sell a striker who is under contract until 2020.
