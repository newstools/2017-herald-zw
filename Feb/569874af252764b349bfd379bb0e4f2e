The plight of mental health patients needs to be looked into seriously as they have the same right to treatment as their medical side counterpartsDr Sacrifice Chirisa :Mental Health MattersMedical funders, aka medical aid societies, in our nation seem to turn a blind eye to the plight of mental health patients despite the glaring statistics of their dominance in the medical arena. With over 40 percent general family practitioner consultation being psychosomatic in nature, five out of 10 of the top 10 burden of diseases being mental health issues, it is a surprise to see this attitude.The mental health cover of most local medical aid societies is a small fraction of the medical health cover per year not only that, it is also the lowest and with the most restrictions.It is as if mental health issues are not medical in nature: a shocking attitude.Medical aid societies refuse to cover the treatment of para-suicidal patients yet suicide is a result of mostly depression, the leading psychiatric condition.This is a psychiatric condition that can be treated and managed.What should these patients do as nobody invites a mental condition? This is in my opinion stigmatising and an unfair practice.In addition, medical aid societies refuse to cover the treatment of alcohol and substance induced psychiatric condition.Yet they will cover for example the treatment of a person who breaks his leg or is injured in say a road traffic accident he or she got into because of alcohol and substance intoxication and abuse.This is not bad in it self, but I am calling for fair and same treatment of mental health conditions.The cost of this is way greater than rehabilitating these persons from the substance use to decrease both mental and medical conditions as a result of alcohol and substance abuse. This will in turn decrease the cost of associated medical costs in the long run.This has already happened in other progressive states where wellness programmes are supported to cut future costs.Furthermore, many of the medications used by psychiatric patients are not covered by medical health funders, leaving psychiatric patients to fund this for themselves and in most cases import these for themselves at astronomical costs.Most psychiatric conditions are chronic in nature or are on and off, requiring long life and on going follow up just like diabetes and hypertension.However, medical funders are very active on this condition, which is not a bad thing, but should start now to take mental health conditions with same seriousness.Last, but not least, medical aid societies need to understand the role of the psychiatrist: doctors who specialise in the discipline of psychiatry, in the management of mental health issues and other medical cadres and reward them for their work just as they do the other specialists like physicians.I have personally interacted with most medical aid societies and there is shocking ignorance of mental health issues, this in my opinion has led to it being ignored in their workings.This can be addressed by organising seminars with the Zimbabwe College of Psychiatry to share experiences and map a way forward for the good of mental health patients in our country.This is a synopsis as to why I am advocating for mental health patients who when they speak are largely ignored.I firmly appeal to the powers that be to seriously look into the plight of mental health patients who have the same right to treatment as their medical side counterparts.Next week we will look at drug abuse challenges in Zimbabwe.Dr S.M.
