MUNICH. Bayern Munich star Philipp Lahm has decided to retire from playing at the end of the season and will leave the club. The World Cup winner made his 501st appearance for Bayern in the German Cup win over Wolfsburg on Tuesday night, as Douglas Costa s goal separated the two sides. Lahm (33) has a contract until 2018, but has elected that he will call time on his illustrious playing career a year early.And the former German international, who has never been sent off in his career, will also walk away from the Allianz Arena after rejecting a role within the club s hierarchy. I told the officials that I will stop playing football at the end of the season, Lahm confirmed after the game. I think this is the right point in time to leave. I see my leadership style as giving everything, every day. Every training session, every game. I m capable of this until the end of the season. But not beyond it. That s why I decided to stop. Lahm has been in negotiations over a move into the role of sporting director, which has remained empty since Matthias Sammer left the club last summer. However, Lahm is understood to have decided against joining the powers that be at Sabener Strasse, following a structural change at the club.At a board meeting earlier this week, it was decided that the club s senior management &#8211; including club president Uli Hoeness and CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has the power to veto any transfers where the total package exceeds 25million.
