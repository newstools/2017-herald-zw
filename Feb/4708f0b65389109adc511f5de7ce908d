PARIS. &#8211; Britain was defaulted into the Davis Cup tennis quarter-finals on Sunday while Spain edged Croatia to advance and defending champion Argentina battled Italy into a decisive fifth match at a rain-hit tie. Canada s Denis Shapovalov hit chair umpire Arnaud Gabas in the face with a ball and was defaulted in the deciding match, handing Britain s Kyle Edmund a 6-3, 6-4, 2-1 triumph and giving Britain a 3-2 victory in the first-round tie at Ottawa. It was a strange way to finish, Edmund said. I ve never been part of something like that. Shapovalov, a 17-year-old Israeli-born Canadian, apologised to Gabas in the referee s office as the umpire was being treated for bruising and swelling of his left eye before being taken to a nearby hospital. No one is nicer or carries themselves better for a 17 y/o than Shapovalov, Canadian teammate Vasek Pospisil tweeted. Everyone can see that today was an accident. Pospisil had blasted 25 aces in a 7-6 (7/3), 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7/5) victory over Dan Evans to level at 2-2 for Canada, which was without injured world number four Milos Raonic. Britain won Saturday s doubles match. Edmund lost to Pospisil in Friday s singles and Shapovalov fell to Evans. &#8211; AFP.
