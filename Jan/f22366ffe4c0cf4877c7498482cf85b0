MANCHESTER. Bastian Schweinsteiger marked his first Manchester United start for a year with a goal and an assist in a convincing 4-0 FA Cup win over Wigan. Marouane Fellaini got on the end of Schweinsteiger s cross to put the holders in front just before half-time in this fourth-round tie.Chris Smalling made it 2-0 following a cross from Anthony Martial, who set up Henrikh Mkhitaryan to tap in the third.Schweinsteiger completed the scoring with an overhead kick from close range.Wigan, 22nd in the Championship, had stood up well to the 12-time winners before conceding three goals in 24 second-half minutes. United, who made nine changes to the side that faced Hull in the second leg of their EFL Cup semi-final on Thursday, sent on substitute keeper Joel Pereira, 20 and defender Axel Tuanzebe, 19, for their debuts.This was an opportunity for a number of United players to prove a point to Mourinho and after a slow start, they responded with a professional performance as they swept aside the 2013 winners.Schweinsteiger made his first start since January 9, 2016, Luke Shaw started for the first time since November 30 and Martial had a chance to show he has a long-term future at Old Trafford.Martial struggled to impose himself up front before he was moved out wide and chipped in with two assists.Midfielder Schweinsteiger was training with the Under-23 side not long ago, but has battled his way back into Mourinho s starting plans.The former Germany captain (32), has been linked with clubs in the United States yet his second half display suggested he has not given up on his Old Trafford career.Wigan, managed by former United reserve boss Warren Joyce, started well at Old Trafford with Callum Connelly and Max Power forcing early saves from Sergio Romero.But once Fellaini rose above Connelly to nod United in front just before half-time, the visitors looked unlikely to turn the game round. Romero denied David Perkins before Smalling took advantage of poor marking to meet Martial s cross and make it 2-0.United s third came when a Wigan corner was cleared by Schweinsteiger to Rooney on the halfway line, who laid it off into the path of Mkhitaryan. He freed Martial, who in return teed up the Armenian to finish.Meanwhile, Sutton United pulled off one of the biggest shocks of this season s FA Cup with a fourth-round win over Leeds, a team 83 league places above them.Jamie Collins second-half penalty sent the National League side through to today s draw with a deserved victory over Championship opposition.Sutton, the lowest-ranked team left in the competition, dominated throughout and forward Roarie Deacon had a goal controversially ruled out for offside.
