Meanwhile, the condition of crops in most parts of the country has been described as satisfactory.Zimbabwe Commercial Farmers Union president Mr Wonder Chabikwa, yesterday said farmers who planted with basal fertilisers had a good crop.He said farmers were still planting in some areas but said the window would soon be over.
