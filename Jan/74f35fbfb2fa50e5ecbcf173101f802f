(0) 1 GOALKEEPER Edmore Sibanda was on target as CAPS United ended their tour of Zambia with a win over hosts Zanaco in an international friendly match at the Nkolomo Stadium yesterday.Sibanda s 24th minute free kick and another strike from Abbas Amidu in the 59th minute was all the Zimbabweans needed to put smiles on their faces having begun the tour on losing note last Friday when they suffered a 2-0 loss to Red Arrows.However, Makepekepe coach Lloyd Chitembwe was still not satisfied despite the win over the Zambian champions yesterday. I am not reading much into the games. To us we just call them training games. It s only three weeks since we started preseason training and the results are meaningless to me at the moment. At the moment I can t demand from my players but we need to keep on working hard as we prepare for the Champions League. Both teams were technically good and they are well coached. I hope the players will continue with their desire to work hard and succeed, said Chitembwe.Sibanda opened the score sheet for the visitors when he unleashed a thunderbolt past the Zanaco wall after Phineas Bamusi was brought down at the edge of the box.Amidu extended the lead when he responded to stand-in captain Leonard Tsipa s pass on the left and found the back of the nets via the post.The Zambian nearly pulled one back in the 73rd minute when they were awarded a dubious penalty by the Zambian referee who adjudged Ernest Mbewe to have been brought down by Ronald Pfumbidzayi.But Augustine Mulenga was denied by the crossbar. The Zambian seven time champions got another penalty after the referee adjudged Dennis Dauda to have handled in the box in the 78th minute. Timothy Sakala who took the responsibility and sent Sibanda the wrong way.
