LONDON. Arsene Wenger says he regrets allowing Jack Wilshere to leave Arsenal on loan because he is left with few options in midfield. Wilshere left the Gunners for a season-long move to Bournemouth in a bid to prove his fitness and earn a new contract at the Emirates Stadium. The England international has enjoyed a run of games on the south coast, something he had failed to do in three years at Arsenal as he was plagued by injuries.There is no option for Arsenal to recall the 25-year-old despite injuries ruling out Francis Coquelin and Santi Cazorla, while Mohamed Elneny is away on international duty with Egypt.Asked if he regretted allowing Wilshere to leave, Wenger said: Yes, I could use him now. But if he had not played until now, he would not be ready to play now.What looks unfair at some moments in the season is that you know at some stage you could need the player. Sky Sports.
