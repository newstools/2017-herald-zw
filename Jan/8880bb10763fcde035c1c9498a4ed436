MANCHESTER. Record-breaker Wayne Rooney says he is not interested in leaving Manchester United for the moment. The Manchester United captain has been linked with a lucrative move to China and manager Jose Mourinho says he won t stand in his way. But despite admitting he is frustrated by losing his regular place in the team, Rooney is planning to see out the remaining 18 months on his current contract, and has not ruled triggering an extra year s option that would keep him at Old Trafford until 2019. I m committed to the club, he said. I ve still got two years a year with an option year to go. I m happy at Manchester United. I ve been at the club a long time. Of course I want to play more games, but I m in a happy place at the moment. You want to play every game if you can but it doesn t always happen how you like it. Once you lose that ambition to play every game then you are sort of accepting a different type of role which I am not ready to accept yet. Rooney is convinced Mourinho will bring the glory days back to Old Trafford but admits that with runaway leaders Chelsea showing no signs of slipping, United s first priority is to secure a Champions League place.I m 100 percent certain Jose will bring titles back to the club. I ve been here a long time and you do get a feeling of what is going to happen in the next two or three years, he said. Jose is certainly the right manager for the football club and in the next few years the club will be very successful. It is too early to talk about a title challenge. Chelsea are doing really well and we need to keep picking up points to stay in touch with the teams just above us, and overtake a few of them first, before we can even look at catching Chelsea. Rooney, who came off the bench to score the equaliser at Stoke on Saturday and claim the club s scoring record, is set to start when United bid to secure a League Cup final place at Hull tomorrow night, leading 2-0 from the first leg of the semi-final.
