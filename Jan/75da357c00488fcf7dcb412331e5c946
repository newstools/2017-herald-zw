PORT-GENTIL. Mahmoud Kahraba scrambled in the winner in the 88th minute as Egypt beat Herve Renard s Morocco 1-0 on Sunday night to reach the semi-finals of the African Cup of Nations. A tense last-eight tie in Port-Gentil seemed destined for extra-time until Kahraba, come on as a substitute, stabbed the ball over the line after the Moroccan defence had failed to cut out a corner. The Pharaohs, record seven-time winners of the trophy, now advance to a semi-final against Burkina Faso in Libreville on Wednesday after claiming a rare victory against their north African rivals.The 1-0 scoreline also means Hector Cuper s side have still not conceded a goal in four games in Gabon. It was a very complicated match for both teams for 94 minutes. We both had chances but we were lucky to get the goal from a dead ball, said Argentine Cuper. Defeat for Morocco means Renard, following previous triumphs with Zambia and the Cote d lvoire, will not become the first man to win a third Cup of Nations title here with a third different country.
