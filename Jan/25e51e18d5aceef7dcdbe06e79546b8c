Tafadzwa Zimoyo Silver Screen &#8212; The year 2017 has kicked off to an interesting start particularly on the social media pages of our local wannabes and celebrities. This weekend was filled with entertainment, thanks to Facebook Live and some people are wondering whether the whole Olinda and Stunner episode can be turned into a reality show. Others have seized the opportunity and created a chat show on Live Facebook which is quite interesting and one wonders where all this will lead us as a nation.On to television and last week ZBC programming received thumbs in 2016.Yes, the station did well and continues to promote local talent. The onus is now on directors, film-makers and producers to continue to provide the national broadcaster with quality products.This week, focus is on DStv, a platform which continues to shine on the African continent.Zambezi Magic has managed to lift up our local content which is a positive. But remember charity begins at home, before posting those videos, movies, films and dramas, let us have a share on our local channel.The weekend saw our local film Playing Warriors which was written and directed by top Zimbabwean film-maker Rumbi Katedza, airing on Zambezi Magic.It was certainly long overdue for the film to be watched by a wider African audience.Still on DStv, there were a lots of queries from customers on when the new season of Strictly Come Dancing will be starting.
