The Warriors lost the match 2-4 and crashed out of the tournament.But for Musekiwa, there was some consolation from one of the tournament sponsors, Orange. NetOne sponsored Musekiwa s travel to Gabon and stay in that country together with his fellow cheerleader Alvin Aluvha Zhakata.A number of other supporters also won tickets through the NetOne promotions. I won a trophy, and I have been given a VIP invitation to watch the final seated with CAF leadership alongside other Super Fans voted from other matches, said Musekiwa. I will also be offered two nights hotel accommodation.It was God s favour indeed. At least as a country we got a consolation prize, we are not coming home empty handed. We never gave up even when chips were down. I am forever grateful to my sponsors NetOne, who flew us to Gabon where my efforts as a cheerleader were rewarded at the grand stage. I am dedicating the award to all Zimbabweans. We won this consolation prize together. At least we managed to make our presence felt in the terraces by proudly raising our flag high.
