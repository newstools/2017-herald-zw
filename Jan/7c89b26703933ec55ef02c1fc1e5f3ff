Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter&#8212;PREMIERSHIP giants Dynamos have announced plans to start the pre-season early and will next week open the doors to their training ground at Motor Action for trials in efforts to beef up their stocks. The club s secretary Webster Marechera yesterday said the coaches will run a week-long player assessment programme starting from next Monday up to Friday.DeMbare, who have often admitted they are finding it difficult to cope with the big money being dangled by the majority of corporate-owned teams in the league, are not likely to be heavily involved on the market during the off-season despite losing some of their key players.With their financial woes documented, especially following the expiry of their sponsorship deal with BancABC, the former champions do not find it within their means to compete against their rivals for the big name players.Marechera yesterday said they will get their pre-season in motion by inviting talented players for assessment by the coaching team led by Lloyd Mutasa before they kick-start the preparations for this year on January 23. We have not finalised on the pre-season plan as yet but so far the coaches have indicated they are rolling out their trials programme next week. This is just a precursor to the start of the proper pre-season. The coaches want this programme to assess talented young players who might be interested to play for Dynamos and then from January 23 we would know what exactly needs to be done, whether to add more names or not. Now it s the trials, that s what we are focusing on, said Marechera.DeMbare, who have struggled to keep afloat under the disabling economic environment, have so far lost key players such as Soccer Star of the Year finalist Godknows Murwira and Brett Amidu to financially stable sides Ngezi Platinum Stars and FC Platinum.Midfielder Dominic Mukandi has also been linked with a move to newboys Ngezi Platinum Stars, who will be playing in the CAF Confederation Cup this year. DeMbare are also battling to retain other key players such as Ocean Mushure, Tatenda Mukuruva and skipper Stephen Alimenda, whose contracts have run out.
