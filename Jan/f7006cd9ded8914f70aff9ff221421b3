Los Angeles. Soul singer Ray BLK has topped the BBC s Sound Of 2017 list, which aims to predict the most exciting new music for the year ahead. It is the first time an unsigned artist has won the honour which has previously gone to Adele and Sam Smith. I can t believe this is happening, said the 22-year-old, from south London. It s all just so ridiculous!Four of the top five Sound of 2017 acts are black British women, reflecting a rise of female talent in grime and R&amp;B. Ray said she wanted her music to empower women to live life as they want . There are so many societal pressures on women, on how we should behave, and they re all based on male privilege. The Sound of 2017 list was chosen by a panel of 170 DJs, critics and festival bookers. Among them was Jamal Edwards, whose SB: TV YouTube channel has helped launch the careers of Dizzee Rascal, Stormzy and Ed Sheeran. He said he was blown away when he saw Ray BLK perform at one of his club nights last year. She is the whole package, he said. I know she s going to have an amazing year. Some artists have that magic about them, said Radio 1 s Huw Stephens. She has a real, raw talent that cuts through so strongly. She is the real deal. BBC.
