SYDNEY. World Boxing Organisation s welterweight world champion Manny Pacquiao could fight Australian Jeff Horn in Queensland state after officials confirmed yesterday they were in negotiations to host the bout. There has been weeks of speculation that the 38-year-old Filipino dubbed Pacman will get into the ring with Horn in April, possibly in Australia. We now are getting the pieces together to deliver this major fight, Queensland s tourism minister Kate Jones told reporters in Brisbane. We are working very closely with Duco Events, (venue manager) AEG Ogden and as well as the (Brisbane City) Council to secure this fight here in Brisbane. We re hoping to lock this down as soon as possible. Describing it as the largest boxing event in Australia , Jones said her government was keen to secure the fight at the 52 500 capacity Suncorp Stadium. AFP.
