CHRISTCHURCH. &#8211; Tom Latham and Colin de Grandhomme guided New Zealand to a series-sweeping nine-wicket victory over Bangladesh in the second Test cricket in Christchurch yesterday after the visitors suffered another second-innings collapse on the fourth day. Latham (41) and de Grandhomme (33) took their side through to 111 for one at Hagley Oval after umpires extended play by an extra 30 minutes because a result was within sight.Jeet Raval was bowled for 33 by Kamrul Islam about 10 minutes before the scheduled end of play, but de Grandhomme came out and hit two of the first five balls he faced for six to signal s New Zealand s intentions to try and complete victory inside four days. He hit two more in succession to end the game.Bangladesh, who were dismissed for 160 in their second innings in the first test in Wellington after scoring 595 for eight, were bundled out for 173 in their second innings on Monday, setting the hosts a victory target of 109. Today was probably our best day of cricket throughout the series which probably gave us the upper hand, New Zealand captain Kane Williamson said. &#8211; Reuters.&nbsp;
