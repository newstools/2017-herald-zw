MANCHESTER. Pep Guardiola admits he has made some mistakes since arriving at Manchester City but says he is adapting to English football. City progressed into the fourth round of the FA Cup on Friday with a 5-0 win over West Ham, but are fourth in the English Premier League, seven points behind leaders Chelsea, and have been criticised at times this term for spells of inconsistency.Guardiola s side won 10 games in a row in all competitions at the start of the season but have since endured a mixed opening half of the campaign. However, the Spaniard has refused to blame his players for any negative results and says his ideas are sometimes at fault. We gave in the first part of the season some really, really good games and performances. But the moment we felt mistakes, especially in defence &#8211; an own-goal at White Hart Lane, our miss at Celtic in Glasgow &#8211; we lost a little of our confidence to play. Sky Sports.
