MANCHESTER. Jurgen Klopp praised his Liverpool players after their 1-1 draw with Manchester United on Sunday afternoon despite his side conceding a late equaliser from Zlatan Ibrahimovic in a frantic game at Old Trafford. The German manager said his side put together a positive performance in the face of long-ball tactics from the home side. It was a very positive performance, we played the better football, but what can I say? Klopp said after the game. The boys did really well. The performance was good, you can see it is still intense for us at the moment, but we re still playing good football. It s nicer when you have this work-rate and you have all three points. Liverpool took the lead in the first-half through a James Milner penalty following Paul Pogba s handball but United began to get back into the game in the second-half.Marouane Fellaini came on as a substitute in the 76th minute and helped to set up Ibrahimovic s equaliser a few minutes later as United played a more direct version of the game. It was on the edge, it was quite hectic, Klopp said. We could have been more clinical, but in the last 20 minutes United were doing only long balls, it was difficult. Klopp also singled out 18-year-old right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold after his first Premier League start. It was an outstanding performance, the German manager added. It is good to have him, the right-back spot is in good hands even when [Nathaniel] Clyne isn t fit. The Independent.
