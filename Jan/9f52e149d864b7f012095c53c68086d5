LONDON. &#8211; Manchester City supporters must once again wait to see which version of Pep Guardiola s team shows up in today s FA Cup fourth-round game at English Premier League soccer rivals Crystal Palace. City have won by four goals or more on five separate occasions, but have also fallen to two 4-0 defeats &#8211; at Barcelona and more recently Everton &#8211; and been beaten five times in the league.January has been every bit as see-saw, with City winning 5-0 at West Ham United in the FA Cup, losing 4-0 at Everton and then going 2-0 up against Tottenham Hotspur on their last outing, only to draw 2-2.Faced with the team s wildly oscillating form, under-pressure goalkeeper Claudio Bravo has told his team-mates: We must be mentally strong. We must keep working hard, keep believing in what we re doing. It s the only recipe. It s not a good feeling looking at how things developed (against Tottenham). We had everything to win the game, but it s the same old story: we had trouble creating chances and the other team, with less options, get the goals. &#8211; AFP.
