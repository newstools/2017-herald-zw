Elita Chikwati Senior Agriculture Reporter &#8212; The announcement of normal to above normal rainfall during the 2016 /17 season by the Meteorological Services Department brought joy not only to farmers producing food crops but also livestock producers who lost huge numbers of animals to drought. Fortunate livestock farmers had taken heed of advice to de-stock by selling unproductive animals to raise funds to buy stockfeed for the remaining herd.Others ignored calls by experts to de-stock and ended up selling their cattle for a song, sometimes at prices as low as $30 per beast. Others watched helplessly while the animals succumbed to drought.The El Nino induced drought affected livestock to the extent that some farmers who normally carried out land preparations using their cattle as draught power failed to do so as the oxen were in poor condition.Now that most parts of the country are receiving the heavy rains, there have been significant changes in both pastures and livestock.Farmers have testified that the condition of their cattle has greatly improved with pastures and water now in abundance.But the rains have also brought with them challenges to farmers producing livestock.The Sadc early warning unit advised farmers, supporting agencies and agricultural experts soon after the 2016 /17 rainfall forecast to be prepared for incidences of pests and diseases for both crops and l ivestock.This was especially relevant in areas where specific pests or diseases tend to occur under conditions of high rainfall.In those areas where normal to above-normal rainfall was expected, farmers and relevant institutions were advised to intensify pest and disease monitoring and surveillance activities, as well as putting in place mechanisms to control potential outbreaks.Already some areas have started experiencing challenges brought on by the rains.The rains wash away the top soil and this may expose livestock, particularly cattle, to diseases.Towards end of last year, Chiweshe in Mashonaland Central, had an anthrax outbreak at Nzvimbo area and farmers lost 27 animals. The Department of Veterinary Services managed to control the disease and cattle were vaccinated.Anthrax is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by bacteria that normally affects animals, especially ruminants.This time of the year, the country experiences more anthrax outbreaks because of the rains that wash away the top soil and expose spores.Signs of anthrax include sudden death of livestock, rapid decomposition of the bloated carcasses and tarry blood coming out of all natural openings.The disease can also affect humans if they come into contact with the blood of an infected animal.The public is advised to refrain from eating uninspected meat from animals that die from natural causes. Suspected anthrax carcasses should not be opened.Government has urged farmers to take care of their livestock during the rainy season to reduce pests and diseases.Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development s Department of Veterinary Services Director Dr Josphat Nyika advised that although the condition of livestock had greatly improved, farmers must take care of their animals to reduce pests and diseases outbreaks. With the current rains, water is available and pastures have improved. The good rains have also brought some harmful effects to animals with regards to tick-borne diseases. Because of the rainy season, we have the highest tick activity. Animals should be dipped every week to prevent tick-borne diseases such as January disease, heartwater and redwater, he said.Dipping is one of the activities that should not be taken for granted during this period.In most areas farmers do not take their livestock for dipping. Some farmers complain of unavailability of dipping chemicals at the community dip tanks but they can also mobilise own resources and protect their livestock.Dr Nyika said farmers should not buy chemicals randomly on the streets but from reputable and registered dealers for effective pest control.The rains have also brought high insect related diseases such as Lumpy skin Disease (LSD).The outbreak of LSD is usually at its peak during the rainy season.LSD is a viral disease of cattle transmitted from one animal to the other by flies.It affects the skin by causing small lumps on the skin that may develop into wounds. In severe cases it may affect the respiratory system and cause death.Affected animals usually recover on their own in two to three weeks time but in some cases the affected animals get secondary bacterial infection which may lead to death.The disease occurs throughout the country and is usually associated with heavy rains over a long period.Continual wet conditions during this period also make animals more vulnerable to LSD as well as other skin diseases.As is the case with most viral diseases, there is no cure for the disease but affected animals may be given antibiotics to protect them from secondary bacterial infection.Farmers are urged to vaccinate their animals against the disease during the dry season so that come rain season animals are already protected.In the face of an outbreak like this, animals that were not vaccinated should be vaccinated immediately. Vaccinating already affected animals is not very useful. It is better to use antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection.Dr Nyika warned that livestock could also suffer from sore eyes during the rainy season.For diseases such as pink eye, animals can be treated with eye ointment or powder.Pink eye is a common infectious disease affecting the eyes of cattle.The name describes the redness and inflammation of the lining of the eyelid and eyeball.Although pink eye is non-fatal, it has a marked economic impact on the cattle industry.Farmers should also keep the animals dry in well drained kraals to avoid foot rot disease. Farmers should have three or more kraals so they can interchange when the area is muddy.Farmers are urged to build at least three kraals to rotate their cattle in the face of the incessant rains which usually provide fertile ground for animal diseases outbreaks.It is a prerequisite for every farmer to dose their cattle to kill germs and prevent disease outbreaks.
