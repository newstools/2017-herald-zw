LONDON. - Even in scoring a stoppage-time equaliser to complete a remarkable comeback, Olivier Giroud has managed to rile Arsenal fans.The Frenchman, who seems to be stuck in a perennial love-hate relationship with Gunners supporters, netted his side s third in an extraordinary 3-3 draw with Bournemouth on Tuesday night. After his dazzling scorpion kick against Crystal Palace two days previously, the strike at the Vitality Stadium ought to have seen the forward free from criticism . . . at least for a few days. But Giroud s celebration made sure that was never likely to be the case. Having netted with a header in the second minute of injury time on the south coast, the frontman wheeled away towards the travelling Arsenal fans, leaping in the air and slapping the outside of each of his feet in homage to his New Year s Day wondergoal.While Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain grabbed the ball and yelled at him to get back into his own half and Gabriel almost ripped the shirt off his back, Giroud was intent on completing his celebration.By the time he d finally emerged from the crowd, most of his team-mates were waving urgently at him to get a move on.With four more minutes of added time still left to play, it might have been wiser to follow that advice and hurry on back to the centre circle. &#8211; Mailonline.
