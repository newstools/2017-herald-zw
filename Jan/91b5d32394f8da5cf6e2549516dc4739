DOHA. China s big spending football revolution poses little threat to Europe because the world s top players want to play in the best competitions, Bayern Munich boss Carlo Ancelotti insisted yesterday. The Italian, who has played for and managed some of Europe s biggest clubs, said modern-day players still chased glory as much as cash. I think that the European clubs are safe because the best competition and the most competitive is Europe, said Ancelotti. Players are not playing only for money, they play to be at the top, to play the best games in the world, so for this reason I think that for the future European clubs are safe. His comments were made in Doha on the final day of Bayern Munich s winter training camp before heading back to Germany.Sharing the same facilities in Qatar this week are Shanghai SIPG, the Chinese club which has just bought Brazilian star Oscar from Chelsea for a reported $60 million euros ($63 million).
