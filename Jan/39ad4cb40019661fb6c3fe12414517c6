Daniel Nemukuyu Senior Court Reporter&#8212;Chief Ngezi, who has been beating up his subjects for alleged disrespect, has been fined after being convicted of several charges.The 35-year-old traditional leader, born Peter Pasipamire, gained notoriety for beating up subjects with the help of his aides, amid reports that he recently stormed three homesteads in Mhondoro and Chegutu where he meted his own version of justice. Four victims made reports to the police, resulting in Chief Ngezi being arrested.On December 29 last year, Chegutu resident magistrate Mr Felix Chauromwe, convicted Chief Ngezi on three separate cases of assault.The youthful traditional leader, in one of the cases, appeared alone charged with assaulting Mr Tirivangani Gore of Plot 18 Borden Farm, Chegutu and was fined $200 or alternatively 60 days in prison.On another record, Mr Chauromwe slapped Chief Ngezi and his two aides Paul Mushonga and Tawanda Mabika with a fine of $200 each or alternatively 60 days behind bars for beating up Mr Thompson Mutashu of Mupingidza Village in Mhondoro.The chief and Mushonga were also found guilty of assaulting Mr Zvinake Zviperi of Mhondoro and were ordered to pay $200 each or spend 60 days in jail.In yet another case which is now at the High Court on appeal, Chief Ngezi was fined $400 for the same charge.He pleaded not guilty to the charges when his four trials opened last year, but was convicted on overwhelming evidence after full hearings.In mitigation, the traditional leader, who is married to three wives with nine children, pleaded with the court for a lighter sentence, saying he was the breadwinner.Being a traditional leader, he pleaded with the court for leniency, saying he risked losing his chieftainship if he was jailed.On June 11, 2015 around 10am, Chief Ngezi and his unnamed aides went to the homestead of Mr Gabriel Musarurwa who had just been convicted at the traditional court and attached two beasts.Mr Gore, who is a nephew to Mr Musarurwa, tried to stop the chief and his aides from taking away the beasts.An altercation ensued, resulting in Chief Ngezi grabbing Mr Gore by the collar, while hitting him with bricks, and fists all over the body.Mr Gore was seriously injured.On another day, Chief Ngezi, together with his aides Mushonga and Mabika went on a revenge mission where they beat up people they suspected to be part of a gang that had previously assaulted the traditional leader.Travelling in two vehicles, the chief s crew went knocking on the suspects doors and assaulting them.Mr Mutashu of Mupingidza Village could not be found at his homestead, but later ran out of luck when the gang apprehended him at Musinami Business Centre in Mhondoro.He was beaten with sticks.Another victim, Mr Zviperi, was seriously injured when the gang beat him up with batons and switches.
