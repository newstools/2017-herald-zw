Tinashe Makichi Business Reporter National Foods is now operating at full capacity on its mills after seeing increased demand following the introduction of import controls on flour. NatFoods managing director Mike Lashbrook yesterday told The Herald Business that the milling company has benefited immensely from the Government interventions. The group s two mills in Harare and Bulawayo are now operating at 100 percent capacity following the support from Government. The three biggest bakeries in the country (Lobels Bread, Bakers Inn and Proton), remain strong and loyal supporters of the Zimbabwean milling industry. NatFoods is happy with the support it is receiving from the baking industry as a whole, said Mr Lashbrook.He said NatFoods had invested $9 million in upgrading its flour milling platform and is now reaping the benefits of the investment. Following that investment, the quality of NatFoods flour is comparable if not better than imports. In the current financial year, NatFoods is set to invest a further $3,4 million towards the milling platform. Support of the milling industry will also aid in the recovery of local agriculture. The milling industry will increase its contract farming hectarage and be the off takers of local wheat produced from the Command Agriculture, said Mr Lashbrook.He said over the past two winter wheat seasons, NatFoods has contracted over 5 000 hectares of local wheat.In addition, the milling company has been the biggest purchasers of local wheat.
