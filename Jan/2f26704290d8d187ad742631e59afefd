it is estimated that 1 in 4 people suffer some sort of mental condition in ZimbabweDr S M Chirisa Correspondent&#8212;I have thought long and hard about this column and believe the time is ripe for it.Of all the things I could write about, one may wonder why I choose a topic on mental health, well, here is a bit of my historical background of what I have experienced that pointed me to this career path. Early in my childhood I had a brother now late, who was in the liberation war.What I can say now is that he probably had post-traumatic stress disorder. At that time, my brother would have episodes of sleepless nights, have vivid recollections and outbursts of violence and he ended up abusing alcohol.What the family did was to tie him to a tree or a bed each time this occurred in-order to restrain him and contain him.Only now I know what to do and who knows life would have turned out better for him, may his soul rest in peace.When I was in my final year (1999) at the University of Zimbabwe, a close friend of mine, a fellow medical student who was academically gifted to genius level I would say, left his satchel in my room one Friday night and asked a group of us his close buddies jokingly, what the best way to end his life would be.We discussed this in amusement and to our shock my dear friend used the very method we all had pointed as the lethal technique two days after our spirited discussion.We never noticed anything wrong with him until the news on his fatal passing away came to us, my friend had ended his life.A few years later, another friend who I attended secondary school with; and finished medical school together, became a drug addict and one sorrowful night overdosed himself to death with one of the drugs.Now very recently, I visited my grandmother with my wife and mum. Granny could not even remember me despite the fact that at one point in my life I lived with her for several years.I then realised that mental health issues surround each one of us in one way or the other.Sometimes we hide from the reality putting on a brave face, while we continue to suffer and experience pain and disruption of life.I have come to the realisation that mental health is as important as physical health. The time has come for us to treat mental health issues with the emphasis and seriousness it deserves.I have seen so many lives and families torn apart due to this condition.It is time for accurate information to be disseminated in our society so that the untold invisible agony many people suffer from can be brought to light.Though Zimbabwe lacks accurate statistics, it is estimated that 1 in 4 people suffer some sort of mental condition.Each one of us can help and facilitate the diagnosis, treatment and the recovery of that one person.In this column, I will discuss mental health conditions and various aspects that pertain to mental health so that useful information is in the public domain.Get understanding to help a loved one. Next week I will look at the topic: What causes mental illness?DISCLAIMER: This column contains information about MENTAL HEALTH RELATED ISSUES.
