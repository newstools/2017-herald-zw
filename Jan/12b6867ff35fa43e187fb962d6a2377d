Nyemudzai Kakore Herald Correspondent&#8212;Chitungwiza Municipality has finally sacked its director of Urban Planning Services Mr Conrad Muchesa after allowing him to illegally draw salaries and benefits two years after his position was made redundant. Mr Muchesa s Grade 15 post was abolished on the organogram in 2014, with his duties transferred to the town planning department that would be superintended by the director of works.His continued employment prejudiced council of over $50 000.Mr Muchesa was served with a dismissal letter on December 21 last year by Town Clerk Mr George Makunde, who indicated to him that his services were no longer required at the municipality. This letter serves to confirm to you that as per the resolution of May 24, 2016, which resolved the town clerk to abide by the organogram, we have to serve you with a notice of termination of work, reads part of the letter. Your duties are no longer required, therefore, you need to come and negotiate your package. Mr Muchesa, in his response dated December 23, 2016 confirmed receipt of the letter, but requested council to offer him the position of town planner which is approved on the organogram.He said he believed council could offer him the new post considering the confidence it had in his services as he sometimes acted as town clerk.Sources said Mr Muchesa highlighted that he was the acting town clerk from December 14 to 20, hence it came as a surprise to him to be handed the dismissal letter the following day. I confirm to be in receipt of your letter, he said in the response. My intention is not to come to discuss my exit package as l am willing to take the position of town planner. Sources said a joint meeting of the Finance Committee and the General Purpose Committee agreed that Mr Muchesa s dismissal letter would be endorsed by a full council, while his request to be offered the town planner position was declined.Council, the sources said, argued that if Mr Muchesa wanted the new post, he should apply like any other employee when the position had been advertised by council.Mr Makunde and Mr Muchesa could not be reached for comment yesterday.
