The two tools are monetary policy tools and fiscal policy tools. With monetary policy tools, Government could consider open market operations where the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe can buy treasury securities on the open market, thereby increasing money in circulation. The increased money will in turn stimulate expenditure, Dr Makochekanwa said. Lowering borrowing interest rates thus making it cheaper to borrow money and this will encourage new investments. This can also encourage individuals to borrow for short and long-term expenditures, he said.Furthermore, to deal with deflation through fiscal policy tools, Dr Makochekanwa said Government could consider increasing its spending on locally produced products. In this case, Government will act as spender of last resort, thereby keeping local production together with employment, said Dr Makochekanwa.The month on month Food and Non Alcoholic Beverages inflation rate stood at 0,38 percent in December 2016, shedding 0,16 percentage points on the November 2016 rate of 0,54 percent.
