JOHANNESBURG. If the 3-0 Test cricket whitewash over Sri Lanka was ever in doubt, the question about whether South Africa will ever play the full five days under Faf du Plessis stewardship remained on Saturday &#8211; as the pitiful visitors were vanquished inside three days. For the eighth time since Du Plessis took over from AB de Villiers, the Proteas finished a Test well inside the distance, this time beating a Sri Lankan team which came, saw and were conquered by an innings and 118 runs.The light work made of a young Sri Lankan side actually on the up, was thanks to a combination of unfamiliar and therefore hostile conditions and a ruthlessness shown by the Proteas of late, especially with the ball.Having successfully negotiated a tricky first morning, and having gone on to be dismissed for 426 on day two (155 of those going to JP Duminy and 134 to Test centurion Hashim Amla), the much-vaunted pace quartet fair blew the visitors away.The win was built on Du Plessis much-debated decision to bat first in the match on a grassy wicket under cloud cover after winning the toss on Thursday.
