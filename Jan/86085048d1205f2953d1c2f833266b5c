LONDON. Where would Arsenal be without Alexis Sanchez? Gunners fans don t ever want to find out. The Chilean has been in stunning form during this season, leading the Gunners challenge both at home and in Europe, and he seems determined to drag the best performances out of his team-mates. By whatever means necessary. Sanchez is regularly seen encouraging the rest of the Arsenal team on the pitch, and it seems as though that determination extends to off it, too. Because as revealed by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, he does even let things rest in the SHOWER.Speaking to the Gunners official membership newsletter, the midfielder said: He s (Sanchez) definitely one of those players who will tend to bring out the best in you because he s very demanding of himself and everyone else. The number of times we ve come off the pitch and we ve won, but he s still not happy with something. The Crystal Palace game for example, we won 2-0 and right at the end of the game he s cut in and he passed it to me. The Mirror.
