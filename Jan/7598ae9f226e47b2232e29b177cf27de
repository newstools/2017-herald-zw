More and more, the idea of taking charge of one s work schedule is appealing to job-seekers in the US. It s also becoming more plausible that they get it. The use of technology is allowing employers to allow their workers to work from home or anywhere they can tote their laptops. That geographical flexibility also has led to greater flexibility of hours, which is incredibly attractive to those for whom meeting familial needs is most important.Other jobs have flexible hours built in. All in all, flexible jobs are on job seekers radars and the concept isn t going away.With that in mind, FlexJobs an online source for flexible work and career information recently released a report highlighting jobs that can be done either remotely or on a flexible schedule that are seeing growth right now. We wrapped that list of occupations into a slide-show, which you can view below.In compiling its list of in-demand flexible jobs for 2017, FlexJobs matched its own database of jobs to two lists produced by two other publications: a report on 10 jobs likely to be in-demand in 2017, by Cheat Sheet; and a roster of jobs with potential this year by FastCompany.Finding the areas where growth jobs matched flexibility, FlexJobs created its own high-potential occupations list.None of them are entry-level positions, mind you, and require experience and, in many cases, educational degrees.Data Scientist is one position we on the FORBES Leadership team have seen listed before on rosters of in-demand jobs with growth potential.According to FlexJobs, these workers gather, process, and analyse large datasets, build learning models, and make recommendations based on their findings. In a world where companies and service providers have access to mass quantities of data on users, customers and markets; having more help to make sense of all the numbers makes Data Scientist an integral part of any growing organisation.Another position that has seen growth on the coattails of tech expansion is Information Security Analyst.Those in that role assess, develop, and troubleshoot a company s information security systems and programs, according to FlexJobs.As technology becomes more ubiquitous to every type of company or organisation, those tending to security become ever more in demand.Front End Developer also made the roster of growth jobs that can be accomplished on a flexible schedule, or remotely.Front-end developers are, essentially, hired to code websites, software, and other technology-based products and services.Their daily tasks may include creating new products or services, troubleshooting and resolving issues, and implementing updates, says FlexJobs.As more companies work to build out their systems and implement tech tools to help them operate more effectively, front end folks are needed to a greater degree.
