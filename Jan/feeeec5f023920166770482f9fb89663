Most of the country s major dams continue to be on the rise as the country receives more and more rainfall.

As of today, Lake Chivero is 108 percent full. It becomes one of the various dams which are now full. Acting Harare Water director Eng Hosiah Chisango said the spilling of Lake Chivero would improve not only availability of water, but also its quality. When the lake spills, a lot of dirt is washed downstream, so the quality of raw water is improved, he said.The Meteorological Services Department (MSD) says the country is expected to continue receiving rains up to the weekend, albeit in lower volumes.According to a statement issued by MSD senior forecaster Mr Tich Zinyemba today, several provinces will receive light showers. In Mashonaland Central and Mashonaland West provinces, Harare Metropolitan Province, north of Midlands Province as well north of Matabeleland Province; it is forecast that these areas should be cloudy and cold with light rain, he said.Mr Zinyemba said the greater part of Zimbabwe should expect warmer conditions.
