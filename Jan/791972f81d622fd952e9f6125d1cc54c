Rodreck MutumaEddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter DYNAMOS striker Rodreck Mutuma is in the firing line as he has been named among the players to be offloaded by the Glamour Boys in a pre-season clean out exercise targeting old horses. Mutuma, conspicuous by his absence when the giants regrouped at Motor Action Sports Club to begin preparations on Monday, will not be part of the side after coach Lloyd Mutasa hinted he is not in his plans for this year.Dynamos have already released vice-captain Stephen Alimenda and have also blacklisted defender Sydney Linyama and veteran forward Jacob Muzokomba.The club s president Kenny Mubaiwa confirmed the development after their meeting with the technical team yesterday. Mubaiwa, however, could not release the names of the affected players, although a source said Alimenda, Mutuma, Muzokomba and Linyama were the victims. We had a meeting with the technical team and basically they were giving us a report on the state of the team and how they would want to prepare for the new season. They also reported on the players that have left and the trials they conducted last week. They are also still working on their squad and to that effect, some senior players will be released. These guys still have running contracts with the club but the coaches have hinted they are not in their plans this year. So we will have to work with what the coaches recommend because what we want at the end of the day are results, said Mubaiwa.&nbsp;
