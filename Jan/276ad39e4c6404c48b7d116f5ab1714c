LONDON. &#8211; French holding midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin has joined Everton from Manchester United for an initial fee of 20 million, the Merseyside club said on Thursday. The 27-year-old signed a four-and-a-half-year contract in a deal that could rise to 24 million with bonuses. The move reunites Schneiderlin with Everton manager Ronald Koeman, beneath whom he worked for one season during his time at Southampton. Everton is a big club in the history of English football, Schneiderlin said in comments published on the Everton website. I ve always loved the atmosphere in the stadium. I ve always liked playing here. I can t wait to play and to represent this great club. There is a manager in place here that I know. I know he can get the best out of me, I know his style and how he likes to play football. Schneiderlin made just eight appearances for United following Jose Mourinho s appointment as manager last year. He posted a picture of himself in a United shirt on Twitter, accompanied by the words: Thank you Manchester United. &#8211; AFP
