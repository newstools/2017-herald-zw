Glen Forest reception areaMunyaradzi Chamalimba Cool Lifestyle Reporter Glen Forest College has opened doors of great academic opportunities to Goromonzi District and surrounding communities,.The college has embraced the new curriculum and put its full thrust and focus on the major pillars of academic excellence. Principal of the college Mr Edwin Mutombe said the college has increased on capacity and offers a conducive learning environment due to low human traffic in the area. We have now worked on a number of areas and this institution, which was formerly a youth training centre, has a capacity of accommodating about 135 boarding students and a sizable number of day scholars There will be no major differences between the boarding scholars and the day ones as they will all enjoy equal services and attention in regards to meals, amongst other things as we have a very conducive learning environment, he saidAgriculture has been a major success at the college which currently has fowl runs that have a carrying capacity of 6 000 chickens and hectares of land for crops. We have real facilities in terms of agriculture, which is a major priority in our national development as a country. If we train such skills seriously at the grassroots then we can surely get the nation to be the breadbasket of Africa once again for we are imparting the relevant skills and knowledge to the future generations who will as well make an expansion on the creation of value, he said.The college also has a capacity to transform surrounding communities as it will soon become a study and examination centre for members of the community who would want to boost their knowledge in different academic disciplines.
