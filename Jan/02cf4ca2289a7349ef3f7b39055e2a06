Studies have shown that severe or long-lasting stress can change the way nerve cells within these circuits transmit information from one region of the brain to another.Other studies have shown that people with certain anxiety disorders have changes in certain brain structures that control memories linked with strong emotions.In addition, studies have shown that anxiety disorders can run in families, which means that they can at least partly be inherited from one or both parents, similar to the genetic risk for heart disease or cancer. Moreover, certain environmental factors such as a trauma or significant event may trigger an anxiety disorder in people who have an inherited susceptibility to developing the disorder.Fortunately, much progress has been made in the last two decades in the treatment of people with mental illnesses, including anxiety disorders.Although the exact treatment approach depends on the type of disorder, one or a combination of the following therapies may be used for most anxiety disorders:Medication used to reduce the symptoms of anxiety disorders include many of antidepressants, low-dose anti-psychotics and other anxiety-reducing drugs.Psychotherapy, a type of counselling in its simplest form addresses the emotional response to mental illness.It is a process in which trained mental health professionals seek to help people by talking through strategies for understanding and dealing with their disorder.Next week I will look at how local medical funders a.k.a medical aid societies deal with mental health patients.
