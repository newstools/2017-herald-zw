On November 21 last year, the trio allegedly lied that another company was offered a contract worth $82 170 and $6 000 was needed for the job.Fortune Investments was promised payment after the companies had completed their jobs.The company was given fake purchase order and in December last year, its managers realised that they had been duped.The company lost $289 980 and nothing was recovered.
