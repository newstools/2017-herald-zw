Tawanda Matanhire Arts Correspondent &#8212; Graphic designer Trulin Munyaradzi recently launched a clothes label named Hobho Hobho in Avondale, Harare, at the weekend, a collection which he hopes will hit the local and regional market. Hobho Hobho comes in different ranges which include baseball caps, T shirts, track suits and tennis shoes.Drawing inspiration from his very first T-shirt design, Munyaradzi says he wishes to increase his range to include an array of clothing. The first design I did inspired me to come up with a range and now my goal is to do a lot more and increase my range, Munyaradzi said. I would want to increase my range so that it includes belts, overalls, jeans and shirts among other things so am in the process of designing these, he added.Hobho Hobho also comes with other range names which include Mutendi, Afro Ape, Dunhu Racho 442,4Hs and 4Bs which have been well received in the market.After doing a market research for his range Munyaradzi said that he felt that the clothing industry was suffocated with the same clothes and designs which people get from either South Africa or China so he thought of bringing a product that was locally made and original to suit the market. The level of creativity is limited here in the country that is why people are importing most of the clothes we wear from South Africa or China, Munyaradzi said. This prompted me to design clothes that are originally from Zimbabwe because I now know the immediate needs of my customers and would want to suit their needs, and in the process meeting market expectations, he added.The youthful designer said that he was not looking into competing with anyone in the market but rather compliment what was already there and giving his own taste of clothing.His ranges are targeted at anyone who can relate with them and this includes the young and old people of both sexes.He has exhibited at local events including the Hustlers Market and is looking forward to showcase his designs at Shoko Festival and Hifa in 2017.Munyaradzi said that he has since roped in a colleague Jonathan Chikuni who is the production and marketing manager of the range, saying the team had managed to secure meaningful markets locally and in South Africa.
