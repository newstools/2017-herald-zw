LIBREVILLE. &#8211; Gabon talisman Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang admitted that the African Cup of Nations hosts had blown their chance and blamed a poor build-up to the soccer tournament after they were sent packing in the group stage on Sunday night. We had chances. Unfortunately there are days when it doesn t go in, said the Borussia Dortmund striker, who missed a glorious early opportunity for the Panthers as they drew 0-0 with Cameroon in Libreville.Denis Bouanga also struck the post in stoppage time before Didier Ndong s follow-up was saved by Fabrice Ondoa in the Cameroon goal. A third draw in as many matches was not enough and they were eliminated as Cameroon and Burkina Faso went through instead.The exit came after a poor build-up to the tournament, including a late decision to appoint veteran Jose Antonio Camacho as coach and a late start to a training camp. We were supposed to start on January 3, but we started a little bit late. We didn t really have the time to prepare, lamented the French-born striker. I am really proud of all the players, because everyone gave their all. I think we were stronger than every other team in the group, but it is about everything, the preparation, the change of coach, it wasn t easy. - AFP.
