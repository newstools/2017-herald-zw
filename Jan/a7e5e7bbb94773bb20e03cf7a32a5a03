Thupeyo Muleya: Beitbridge BureauZIMBABWEANS must be wary of dubious characters who invite them to South Africa on false promises of well-paying jobs when in fact they are fraudsters and human traffickers. The country s Consul-General in South Africa, Mr Batiraishe Mukonoweshuro, told The Herald on Monday that many Zimbabweans had fallen victim to conmen. Such fraudulent incidences were quite rampant between 2014 and 2015. The consulate embarked on a campaign to educate fellow Zimbabweans and it seemed to slow down in 2016. We always urge those willing to do business, to contact the Trade and Investment Promotion Officer at the consulate for any assistance or verifications required, he said.Mr Mukonoweshuro named one of the conmen as Wallace Dube. He said Dube was running adverts in Zimbabwe targeting job-seekers especially boilermakers, electricians and fitter and turners.He claims the professionals are wanted in North West and Witbank. Dube was also sending people emails lying he had procured employment for them at Orkeny Gold Mine in Northwest Province. He charges those without work permits R6 000 alleging that he has an agent who processes the permits for R12 000, and that he will pay the other R6 000 for a few short-listed candidates. In one of the adverts he said the work permits will be processed in two weeks and that the prospective candidates should travel to South Africa on February 3 for medical examinations and start working, said Mr Mukonoweshuro. He is a fraudster and people should ignore such kind of messages. He said Dube was busted before he could dupe more people. The consulate is checking with the police if he is not on the wanted list already.
