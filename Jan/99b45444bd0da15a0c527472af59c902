Herald Reporter&#8212;A local company has embarked on a housing scheme modelled along South African urban settlements at the junction of High Glen Road and Kambuzuma covering 56 hectares of land. Running under the Aspindale Park Property Development banner, the project comprises 1 200 residential stands measuring between 200 square metres and 400 square metres, as well as other mixed land uses aimed at supporting the residents.Aspindale Park project manager Mr Michael Swan told The Herald yesterday that the civils side of the project will be completed by end of this year. The property will have all the desired services and amenities, in addition to durable roads, water, electricity and sewer connectivity. The stands will also be provided with solar-powered street lights and high-speed fibre Internet connectivity. Aspindale Park will be a community like no other, offering a premium lifestyle in the centre of the Sunshine City, he said. In line with the short-term plan, quality schools, churches, day care centres, fuel filling stations with their ancillary services as well as a top class clinic will be constructed within the community catering for residents every need. Mr Swan said this is an area reserved for small and medium enterprises in a move expected to create employment while serving and supporting the Aspindale Park community. Small and medium enterprises will be established in the development to provide access to shops, markets and suppliers within walking distance of the residences. The property boundary will be secured providing a safe haven for families to flourish in. These amenities will create massive scope for employment and economic development as well as investment opportunities, he said.Mr Swan said the Aspindale Park development plan was approved by the City of Harare as well as EMA.
