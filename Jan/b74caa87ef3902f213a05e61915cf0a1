JOHANNESBURG. Former Proteas coach Eric Simons is concerned that fast bowler Kyle Abbott s departure may destabilise the Protea s recent progress. Abbott had his contract with Cricket South Africa terminated abruptly a few days ago after revealing he had signed a Kolpak deal with English County side Hampshire, meaning he is unavailable for the Proteas as early as Thursday, when they play their third and final Test against Sri Lanka in Johannesburg.While not critical at all of the 29-year-old s decision, Simons was more worried about its possible repercussions on the Proteas remarkable resurgence in the past six months, a period in which they won three Test series (against New Zealand, Australia and Sri Lanka) and an ODI series against the Aussies by a 5-0 whitewash. He s played a critical role for the team. I wonder if it s going to affect the morale of the team, he said. We talk about the team being so tight-knit and having such a sense of unity. I think they re going to miss him a lot. AFP.
