LONDON. Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino believes rival English Premier League soccer managers and fans want his team to win when they tackle leaders Chelsea at White Hart Lane tomorrow night. With Chelsea six points clear, Pochettino thinks Liverpool, Arsenal and the two Manchester clubs will be hoping for a Spurs victory to stop Antonio Conte s team widening the gap at the top.Furthermore, the Argentine says it will be good for the league as a whole, as well as for Tottenham, if Chelsea fail to set a new record of 14 successive English Premier League victories within the same season. I think it s important for the Premier League and for us to try to win and try to stop them and reduce the gap because in the end for us the challenge is to try to be at the top, Pochettino said after his side s 4-1 win at lacklustre Watford on Sunday.Last season the situations were reversed, with many neutrals wanting Tottenham to falter against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge so unlikely contenders Leicester City could take the title.Their wishes were granted as a stormy 2-2 draw delivered the championship to the King Power Stadium. Yes, maybe we will feel how Leicester felt last season when all the teams were with them and against us, Pochettino said. Maybe they felt the same as us last season. However, he warned it will be tough for Tottenham against Conte s turbo-charged team. You know Chelsea arrive in very good shape, us too after the last few games, he said. For me it will be a very, very tough game to try to stop them and try to reduce the gap. The win at Watford was a perfect warm-up, effectively decided by half-time when Spurs led 3-0 despite the absences of suspended duo Jan Vertonghen and Kyle Walker, both of whom will be available to face Chelsea. The first half was great. I think it was one of the best performances so far, said Pochettino, whose side supplanted Manchester City in the Champions League places on goal difference. AFP
