Tedious Manyepo Sports Reporter&#8212;THE days when Zimbabwe Karate Union struggled to finance tournaments and send representatives to international competitions could be over after the country s biggest sports betting house, AfricaBet, made a commitment to bankroll the sport in the country. The betting company initially injected around $10 000 into the sport which helped the ZKU to successfully hold their annual national championships in December last year.They have since followed that up with a donation of head gears and a tatami which were handed over to ZKU in a ceremony attended by a number of karate personalities, including ZKU president Joe Rugwete in Harare last Friday.AfricaBet chief executive Brian Makwabarara said his organisation is ready to work with the ZKU. We are very proud to be associated with the ZKU who we have gathered to hand over a tatami that will go a long way in the development of the sport. As AfricaBet we are happy for the sponsorship and I hope it will go a long way in developing the sport. Karate is known for discipline so we are proud to be part of them. The association is known as the best administered sport in the country for the past two years so we saw it fit to back their endeavours. We have managed to sponsor the champion of champion tournament that was held in December and it was successful so we look forward to continue with this good working relationship, he said.Zimbabwe Olympic Committee president Admire Masenda received the donated consignment on behalf of ZKU. I hope to see other corporates emulate what AfricaBet has done. The training material will help the association in a big way and as we seek to see karate as an Olympic sport in 2020 and it is encouraging to have such a foundation, said Masenda.
