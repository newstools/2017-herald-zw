GAUTENG. England s Graeme Storm beat Northern Ireland s Rory McIlroy in a play-off at the South African Open to claim his first European Tour victory since 2007. The pair finished on 18 under after four rounds at the Glendower Golf Club in Johannesburg with 38-year-old Storm winning after three extra holes.Storm nearly lost his Tour card in 2016 but held his nerve to defeat the world number two for his second Tour title.His only previous success came at the French Open in July 2007. In November, Storm finished 100 euros short of the prize money needed to guarantee his spot for this season.However, he kept his Tour card after American Patrick Reed s points were deducted because he had not played in the minimum number of tournaments required. I m shocked. This has been a surreal week and to find myself in the position I was in with probably the best player in the world was a dream come true, said Storm. I got my playing rights due to the fact Patrick could not play and I took it with both hands. To win this tournament with the prestige of it is incredible. England s Jordan Smith finished third for the best result of his career, while fellow Englishman James Morrison tied in 13th.Storm had held a three-shot advantage over McIlroy after Saturday s play and shot a final round one-under 71. But a four-under 68 from 27-year-old McIlroy, which included birdies at the first, second, eighth, 13th and 15th and a bogey at the 17th, forced the play-off.In front of a large crowd, both players made pars at the 18th in the first two-extra holes and Storm registered another par before McIlroy s bogey proved decisive.Final scores:1 Graeme Storm (Britain) after 32 Rory McIlroy (Britain) after 3REGULAR ROUNDS-18 Graeme Storm (Britain) 69 63 67 71Rory McIlroy (Britain) 67 68 67 68-17 Jordan Smith (Britain) 67 68 68 68-15 Dean Burmester (South Africa) 67 70 67 69-14 Thomas Aiken (South Africa) 67 70 68 69, Trevor Fisher (South Africa) 66 68 71 69-13 Peter Uihlein (US) 70 64 70 71, David Drysdale (Britain) 70 65 71 69, Mikko Korhonen (Finland) 72 66 67 70, Alexander Bjoerk (Sweden) 68 71 68 68, Joel Stalter (France) 69 70 65 71, Edoardo Molinari (Italy) 71 70 63 71-12 James Morrison (Britain) 70 72 66 68-11 Jeff Winther (Denmark) 69 70 70 68, Gary King (Britain) 73 68 66 70, Richard Johnson (Sweden) 69 70 66 72, Laurie Canter (Britain) 69 66 71 71-10 Tom Lewis (Britain) 72 71 69 66, Jaco Van Zyl (South Africa) 71 65 68 74, Jens Fahrbring (Sweden) 68 71 71 68-9 Jbe Kruger (South Africa) 67 67 69 76, Justin Walters (South Africa) 69 72 67 71, Keith Horne (South Africa) 66 69 70 74, Jacques Blaauw (South Africa) 72 70 67 70, Romain Langasque (France) 70 66 68 75-8 James Kingston (South Africa) 72 71 67 70, Sebastian Soederberg (Sweden) 69 72 70 69, Chris Hanson (Britain) 71 69 66 74, Oliver Fisher (Britain) 68 69 70 73, Darren Fichardt (South Africa) 68 72 70 70-7 Espen Kofstad (Norway) 73 67 76 65, Dawie Van der Walt (South Africa) 71 67 70 73, Mark Foster (Britain) 68 70 73 70, Alexander Knappe (Germany) 71 71 69 70, Brandon Stone (South Africa) 74 67 71 69, Justin Harding (South Africa) 70 70 74 67-6 Paul Waring (Britain) 70 70 74 68, Pontus Widegren (Sweden) 72 67 68 75, Christiaan Bezuidenhout (South Africa) 70 70 71 71-5 Louis De Jager (South Africa) 77 64 67 75, Adilson Da Silva (Brazil) 73 69 70 71, Rourke Van der Spuy (South Africa) 72 70 68 73, Thomas Detry (Belgium) 72 71 69 71, Ulrich Van den Berg (South Africa) 69 70 73 71, Michael Hollick (South Africa) 70 71 73 69, John Parry (Britain) 74 67 72 70, Rafael Echenique (Argentina) 73 70 69 71, Jonathan Agren (Sweden) 73 69 68 73 Supersport.
