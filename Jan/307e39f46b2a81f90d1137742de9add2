Sophie Chese-Msowa Cool Lifestyle Correspondent &#8212; Children in Mhondoro will have something to smile about in the next few months following the launch of the first ever talent search show for children below the age of 12 in that area. The talent search show is set to premiere on ZTV this year. Titled Kinders and Tiaras , the talent search show will see children from three years up to 12 from Mhondoro showcasing their talent in different areas among them modelling, singing, poetry and drama.Running under the theme Discovering your child s talent at an early stage , the talent search show is meant to support young children who are gifted in different ways.It will see both boys and girls battling for the honours in various genres, which will culminate in the announcement of the winner.In an interview, the executive producer of the talent search show Colleen Mabaso said her passion for children forced her to come up with such an initiative meant to nurture talent from grassroots level. I have discovered that rural areas have been marginalised and overlooked when it comes to talent search shows and other activities urban kids are engaged in. I then decided to start this talent search starting in Mhondoro and I am looking forward to spread it to other rural areas, she said.Mabaso who has been working with Youth Power Group Harare said she discovered that rural children were also talented just like those in the urban areas hence the need to also support them. I have always worked with kids so when I started working with children in Mhondoro, I discovered that the children were also talented and were even better than those in the urban areas. I decided to come up with this show which is also meant to boost the children s confidence, she said.She however highlighted that the Mhondoro Community does not have a play centre for children making it difficult for her to have enough space to hold the activities. At the moment we do not have a play centre for children and this is making it difficult to engage in various activities, she said.The talent search show is expected to hit the big screen early next year and modelling would be among the major events.Registering is currently underway for those who have children who want to take part in this inaugural event
