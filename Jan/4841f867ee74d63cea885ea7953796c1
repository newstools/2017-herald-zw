Sulumani ChimbetuArts Correspondent &#8212; After getting inspiration from the latest Jamboree album by Sulumani Chimbetu, local film producer Collen Mugobeya has released a mini-documentary featuring various music listeners who say their views about the new project. Jamboree , which is Chimbetu s fifth album, was released in December last year and has been getting fair airplay from local radio stations.Mugobeya said he was impressed with the latest piece of art and felt he needed to do something so that the album can get more appreciation from fans in and out of the country through social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp. I grew up listening to Dendera and have an appreciation of the music. The latest album reflects maturity on Sulumani`s musical career, which prompted me to do something for my favourite artist, Mugobeya said.The mini-documentary is made of interviews of feedback from fans around the country who have listened to Jamboree and most of them saluted Chimbetu for the good work.Mugobeya said that there is need for the local community to support their artistes so that they get the appreciation they deserve when they do good work. We as the fans play a role to uplift our local artists and there is therefore need to support our local artists by spreading the good message they preach in their songs, he said In this case I believe this is Sulu s best album to date but not everyone has had a chance to listen to it and I believe this production will alert people about the album. Meanwhile, Sulu expressed amusement over the feedback video, saying it came as a surprise to him. I really do appreciate that there are people who can go out of their way to promote my work. I did not know he was making the documentary and I only heard about it when it was out. It is excellent work and I salute him for it, said Sulu.
