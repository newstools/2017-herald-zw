WELLINGTON. New Zealand stormed back into the first Test cricket against Bangladesh yesterday, with three quick wickets to back up a Tom Latham century and set the stage for an intriguing final day in Wellington. After being on the back foot for most of the first four days, New Zealand were boosted by reducing Bangladesh to 66-3 in their second innings, at 122 by stumps. Funny things can happen on that last day as it did against Pakistan in that last series, Latham said, referring to the dramatic finish to the November Test when New Zealand took nine wickets in the final session to beat Pakistan.Bangladesh were also sweating over Imrul Kayes, who was injured on 24 and taken to hospital for hip x-rays.Captain Mushfiqur Rahim, unable to field because of an injured hand, was confirmed as being available to bat if required.Bangladesh have never beaten New Zealand and pace bowler Taskin Ahmed said their chances of a breakthrough victory were damaged with the loss of three wickets in the last five overs on Sunday.Bangladesh had been hoping to declare on Monday in time to give New Zealand a challenging target, but Taskin said that may change.
