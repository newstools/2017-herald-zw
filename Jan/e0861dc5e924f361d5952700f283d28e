MADRID. Cristiano Ronaldo says he is not motivated by money, after his agent, Jorge Mendes, claimed he had rejected a move to China.The Real Madrid star has been linked with a switch to the Far East, after Mendes stated an unnamed Chinese side were willing to pay the 31-year-old an annual wage of 100million &#8211; while handing European soccer champions Real a 200million transfer fee. That deal was rejected as it was impossible for the 2016 Ballon d Or winner to accept &#8211; less than two months after signing a new contract at the Santiago Bernabeu.That new deal currently makes Ronaldo the world s best paid footballer, but in an interview with Egyptian TV, he revealed that his motivation is much more simple than financial reward. In my job I try to be the best, and I work for that, revealed Ronaldo. So this is important for me, to be the No.1, the most valued player. But this is not my motivation. My motivation is to play football, to be the best, and this is what I try to do. The Mirror
