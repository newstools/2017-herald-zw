Faith Mutema Sports Reporter THE 2017 Zimbabwe motorsport season gets underway this Sunday with the staging of the first club event at Donnybrook Raceway in Harare. The event is scheduled to start at 10am and a huge crowd of local motocross fans is expected to grace the occasion. It is the first of more than six national and club events that will be staged during the course of this year. Sunday s event will also see one of the country s top female motocross riders, Tanya Muzinda, returning to the track for the second time inside two months after she spent most of last year on the sidelines for not having a suitable bike to ride on.Muzinda s manager, trainer and father, Tawanda, yesterday confirmed that his daughter will be returning to the track, racing in the 85cc class alongside other top local junior and senior riders. It is exciting to be back to the time of the season we all love the most and we have been preparing for this event since the beginning of the year. The training, however, has been erratic due to continued rains but overall I think Tanya is well prepared and ready for the event, Tawanda Polycup Muzinda said.Tawanda also added that he was positive that his 13-year-old daughter will be flying over the top bend since she proved herself in last year s Zimbabwe Summer series in December when she took the third position overall in her class after having been on the sidelines for almost a year. Tanya is a very strong and competitive rider. She is talented and this event is there to prove how amazing she is as a young rider. Despite the hold backs, she still manages to position herself on the top and I am positive that with the training that she is currently having, she will surpass all obstacles in her way, he added. For this weekend s event Tanya Muzinda will be joined by other top local female riders including 15-year-old Leigh-Anne Young who will be riding in the 125cc class.
