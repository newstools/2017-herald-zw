Paidamoyo Chipunza Senior Reporter&#8212;Government is working on a holistic plan to address social determinants of health, which are expected to ultimately end water borne diseases, cabinet Ministers responsible for health, water and sanitation have said. Speaking after visiting Mbare the epicentre of the current typhoid outbreak and Chitungwiza s sewerage plant yesterday Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Minister Saviour Kasukuwere, who described the state of affairs in Mbare as a disaster , said while the situation cannot be corrected overnight, a plan must be put in place as a matter of urgency to mitigate sewer blockages, uncollected garbage, illegal residents and food vendors. It is a disaster, and really we have to do something about it, said Minister Kasukuwere. Local authorities and officials from the Ministry of Health should engage now than ever to come up with a robust response to a plethora of issues affecting the residents, that is, from rehabilitation of our infrastructure to encompassing new methods, to environmental sustainable management, said Minister Kasukuwere.He said Government recently approved a $30 million request from Harare City Council to assist in their infrastructure requirements and equipment, which must be deployed to the eight districts of the town.Minister Kasukuwere said this approach is expected to allow for a quick response and remedial action to challenges facing residents, thereby improve service delivery. This is a new management structure that is a departure from a heavily centralised and concentrated management structure that is currently in place, he said.Health and Child Care Minister Dr David Parirenyatwa said for as long as these determinants are not addressed, the country will continue to grapple with typhoid and related diseases.Minister Parirenyatwa said the inter-ministerial taskforce on typhoid was expecting Harare to present its plan of action this coming Monday on how they propose to deal with the current challenges. We are going to be meeting on Monday, and we are hopeful that a plan will come up from them, even a draft on how they are going to manage Mbare Musika, sustainable refuse disposal, sewer and the issue of food vendors, said Dr Parirenyatwa.He said the Ministry of Health and Child Care will continue advocating for safe and hygienic conditions to curb the spread of typhoid and offer treatment to all those infected.Harare City Health director Dr Prosper Chonzi, said since the beginning of the current typhoid outbreak, two deaths have been recorded with 24 confirmed cases and 158 suspected cases.He said although cases were going down, the fact that sporadic cases were being recorded in Glen View and Budiriro showed that the outbreak has not yet been effectively controlled in Mbare, where it started.Some Mbare residents interviewed, complained of uncollected garbage especially around Mbare Musika, continued sewer blockages and water cuts in some parts of the district.Chitungwiza town clerk, Mr George Makunde said the authority successfully dealt with a perennial sewer problem that had troubled the town for a long time, and contributed to the 2009 cholera outbreak.So far, no cases of typhoid or cholera have been reported in the town.
