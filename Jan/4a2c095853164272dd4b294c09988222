Controversial gospel star Lundi Tyamara has been hospitalised. DRUM has reliably learnt from several sources close to the award-winning muso, that he s been in a Johannesburg hospital for a month. He is not looking well at all but we are praying that he beats this. He is suffering from abdominal tuberculosis, chest pains and he has had a liver problem for a while now, the first source, who visited him recently in hospital, said.He apparently spent his birthday (December 16), Christmas and New Year in hospital, and is still there fighting for his life .A second source says Lundi, who has been dubbed the prince of gospel and the prodigal son of gospel , is also experiencing breathing problems. I don t think he will be able to perform for a while after being released. It is important that people, especially artists, start taking a good care of themselves and their health. Let s all put him in our prayers as we cannot afford to lose another gospel star like we did end of last year with Sfiso Ncwane, the source, who is a close friend of Lundi s, said.Lundi s manager, Anele Hlazo, could not be reached for comment.However, it s rumoured he dumped his duties managing Lundi s career two months ago.Lundi started his solo career in 1998 and he is known for many gospel hits such as Mphefumlo Wami, Mvuleleni Angene, Mniku dumo, Khuluma Nabo and Inkosi Iyayazi.We wish him speedy recovery.
