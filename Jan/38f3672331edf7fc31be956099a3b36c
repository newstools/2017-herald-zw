JOHANNESBURG. &#8211; Increasingly women are showing an appetite for investing in stock market related products such as Exchange Traded Funds and Shares. This is according to FNB data, which has shown a fivefold growth in share investments by female investors over the last 8 years. Aneesa Razack, CEO of Share Investing at FNB, says In 2008 FNB introduced a suite of share investment products aimed at encouraging South Africans to invest in shares online. For as little as R300 anyone can open a share account and invest in some of the biggest companies listed on the stock exchange. While we have seen a steady increase in the number of investors across the board, we have also noted an upsurge in female investors. This is a good sign considering that when we introduced shares through the FNB Online platform there was a small percentage of female investors. The youngest group of female investors falls within the 21 25 age group, and while this group is by no means the biggest, it s encouraging to see that young people are starting to invest in shares much earlier.The general misconception is that share investing is for the wealthy; however this is not true because anyone can invest in shares as long as they are willing to stay in it for the long-term.With FNB Share Investing investors have the added benefit of investing in Krugerrands via the online platform or the FNB Banking App. Investing in shares has become a lot more accessible because it can be done online, which makes the process cost effective, adds Razack. &#8211; cnbcafrica
