The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said African airlines experienced an 8,2 percent growth in demand last November compared to same month in 2015. IATA represents some 265 airlines accounting for 83 percent of global air traffic. The industry already supports 6,8 million jobs and generates $72,5 billion of economic activity on the continent. In the global passenger traffic update for November 2016, the association said the African region posted robust growth in November last year. Economic conditions in much of Africa remain challenging, particularly in the biggest economies of Nigeria and South Africa but the upward trend in seasonally-adjusted passenger traffic has reasserted itself more recently, supported by strong demand on routes to and from Asia and the Middle East, it said.IATA said capacity rose by 5,1 percent while load factor climbed 1,9 percentage points to 66,3 percent. Going forward, the association said the industry had reshaped itself and strengthened its resilience to shocks.The threat of terrorism, questions over the durability of the economic upswing, rising oil prices and increasing protectionist rhetoric are among the concerns the airline industry faces. We should see another solid year of collective profitability for the airlines in 2017 but we must be vigilant, IATA said. &#8211; New Ziana.
