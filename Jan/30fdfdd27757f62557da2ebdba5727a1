Sports Reporter&#8212;-THE Premier Soccer League have officially advised the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which is based in Switzerland, that they are withdrawing the case related to their dispute with ZIFA. The move follows a decision by the PSL clubs to refuse to be dragged by a clique of rebellious ad-hoc leaders, who wanted to keep alive their dispute with ZIFA over the relegation-and-promotion puzzle and allegations that the association were interfering in the affairs of the top-flight league.Dynamos and CAPS United leaders led the opposition to the move, with DeMbare president Kenny Mubaiwa and the Green Machine boss Farai Jere saying it was a worst of resources given the league had to invest more than 17 000 Swiss francs into the CAS coffers.Now, the PSL clubs, through their lawyers Coghlan, Welsh and Guest, have officially advised CAS that they were withdrawing their case. The clubs also confirmed the co-option of Jere as a member of the three-man Emergency Committee, which is running the PSL following the suspension of the top-flight league s chairman Peter Dube last year.
