SYDNEY. Australia s Nick Lindahl was yesterday banned for seven years and fined US$35 000 for corruption with two others also sanctioned as tennis authorities step up their fight against match-fixing ahead of the first Grand Slam of the year. Lindahl, who reached a career-high ranking of 187, was found guilty of contriving or attempting to contrive the outcome of an event and failing to cooperate with a Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) investigation.The case related to his offer to throw a match at a Futures tournament in Australia in 2013 and a refusal to provide his mobile phone for forensic investigations on the TIU s request. Although Mr Lindahl (28) retired from the sport in 2013, today s decision prevents him from resuming playing professional tennis for the seven years of the ban, the TIU said in a statement. He is also prohibited from attending any tournament or event organised or sanctioned by the governing bodies of the sport for that period. AFP.
