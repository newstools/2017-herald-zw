Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter HARARE Athletics Board chairman Sebastian Garikai says work is already underway in preparation for the inaugural JM Busha 54 marathon slated for May. The province will host the race on May 25 targeting local athletes only. It will be followed by the Elite JM Busha marathon on July 29, which is expected to feature participants from other African countries. Both events are being sponsored by JM Busha 54 Races, who have come on board not only to sponsor the two marathons but other projects run by the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe . The races are meant to promote peace and unity in Africa and the organisation is hoping to stage 54 races across the continent. Speaking on the sidelines of the unveiling of JM Busha 54 Races on Tuesday, Garikai said they have begun working on ensuring the event is a success and the route for the May event is already in place.
