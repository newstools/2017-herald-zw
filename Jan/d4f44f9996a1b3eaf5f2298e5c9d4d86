LONDON. Looking at his body language you could have been forgiven for thinking Alexis Sanchez was on the losing side on Sunday.In the closing minutes of Arsenal s 2-0 English Premiership soccer victory over Crystal Palace the forward couldn t contain his frustration. It appeared the energetic forward was desperate for Arsenal to score more goals. When Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had a shot saved in the late stages Sanchez dropped to his knees. Then at the final whistle he was spotted throwing his arms up in the air in anger before heading straight to the tunnel.Sanchez s desperation for more goals drew a mixed response from Arsenal fans. Some felt he should be happy Arsenal were winning while others praised his attitude for wanting to do better.Arsenal had 22 attempts at goal during the game at the Emirates with seven hitting the target. Sanchez himself had eight strikes at goal but saw just two hit the target and none go in. He did however claim an assist for Olivier Giroud s wonder strike. Metro
