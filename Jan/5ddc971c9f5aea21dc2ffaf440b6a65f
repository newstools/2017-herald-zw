Our strategy for 2017 is to ensure that we account for all wanted persons in relation to stock theft, he said. We also want to intensify our awareness campaigns, especially on cattle branding. As you are all aware, the deadline for branding cattle is December 31, 2017 and we want to make sure that all cattle are branded.
