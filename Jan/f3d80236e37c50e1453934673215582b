BRISBANE. &#8211; Mickey Arthur said yesterday he wants to prove Cricket Australia erred by sacking him as he returns as coach of Pakistan for this week s day-night Test in Brisbane. South African Arthur, who was fired by Cricket Australia on the eve of the 2013 Ashes after a run of defeats and replaced by current national coach Darren Lehmann, will be plotting Pakistan s strategy for the three-Test series that starts at the Gabba on Thursday. Arthur (48) said there was a part of him that still had a point to prove to his former employers. I wouldn t be honest if I said otherwise, he told reporters. That s what happens. It s a ruthless world out there. I always maintain that I loved the first year and a bit of it, it was outstanding and I felt we made some significant progress. This series isn t about me against Australia. It s about two very good cricket teams going head to head, I hope that can be the focus. Arthur said he was coming to terms with his anticipated return to face his former team on the other side. It s pretty surreal really to be walking into the Gabba . . . coming back as a visiting coach, he said. - AFP.
