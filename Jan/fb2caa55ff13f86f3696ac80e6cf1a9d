SEOUL. &#8211; The Democratic People s Republic of Korea said yesterday it can test launch an intercontinental ballistic missile at any time from any location set by leader Kim Jong Un, saying the United States hostile policy was to blame for its arms development. Kim said on January 1 that his nuclear-capable country was close to test-launching an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The ICBM will be launched anytime and anywhere determined by the supreme headquarters of the DPRK, an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by the official KCNA news agency, using the acronym for the country s name.The United States said on Thursday last week that North Korea had demonstrated a qualitative improvement in its nuclear and missile capabilities after an unprecedented level of tests last year.Experts have said that while the DPRK may be close to testing an ICBM, it would likely take years to perfect the weapon.Once fully developed, a DPRK ICBM could threaten the continental United States, which is around 9 000km from the North. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5 500km, but some are designed to travel 10 000km or farther.US President-elect Donald Trump responded to Kim s comments on an ICBM test by declaring in a tweet: It won t happen! A US State Department spokesman said last week that the United States does not believe that North Korea is capable of mounting a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile.The DPRK has been under UN sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. The sanctions were tightened last month after Pyongyang conducted its fifth and largest nuclear test on September 9. The US is wholly to blame for pushing the DPRK to have developed ICBM as it has desperately resorted to anachronistic policy hostile towards the DPRK for decades to encroach upon its sovereignty and vital rights, KCNA quoted the spokesman as saying. Anyone who wants to deal with the DPRK would be well advised to secure a new way of thinking after having clear understanding of it, the spokesman said, according to KCNA. - Reuters-Herald Reporter
