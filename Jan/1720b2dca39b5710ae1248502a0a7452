Naledi Sande Arts Reporter &#8212; Talented wordsmith Princess Musonza has released an album that honours the First Family and preaches Pan-Africanism. The album is titled Restore Identity and Princess writes about culture and bringing back the essence of Ubuntu/Hunhu to Africans. The album is mainly made of poetry spiced with exciting mbira vibes. Restore Identity targets all Africans and seeks to help explore African pride. All we need as Africans is to get over colonisation and build ourselves to be true Africans all over again, said Princess.The collection has eight tracks with Princess reciting her poetry over mbira background and was recorded at Gulleyview Record in Glenview. Five of the tracks are in Shona and bring out facets of traditional lifestyle Zimbabweans had in the past.The 27-year-old started writing and reciting poems in 2005. I can t sing like most people but I still have a voice to speak out. So I feel poetry is the right medium for me to express myself and reach out to people, said Princess.In this collection, Princess honours President Mugabe and the First Lady Dr Grace Mugabe on two separate tracks. His Excellency is an icon and in the poem I bring out his Pan-Africanism. He is leading us as Zimbabweans, showing us what we should be, she said.She added that the President is living amongst us for a reason as he did not put himself in power. On a track titled, A True Mother , Princess says she is honouring the First Lady for being a mother to Zimbabweans and a good wife to the President. I am only describing her as a mom. She is empowering the girl child and making us relevant, she said.Other than poetry, Princess is also a graphic designer although she never studied for it.Her music inspirations are Mbira DzeNharira and Chiwoniso Maraire. These are the people that I enjoy listening to as I wish to reach the stage they reached in life. With the theme I am working on, I wish that the world over understands the idea of restoring identity.
