The turbulent process of coming of age is one that for generations has left scientists and parents baffled.From time immemorial when teenage hood was recognized as a bona fide developmental stage, adolescent remains one big puzzle that society and even the teens themselves battle to deal with. Tantrums, terminal love sickness and peer pressures are some of the issues that teenagers and their parents grapple with on a daily basis.However, that was never the case for Bulawayo-based teenager Marshal Chiza, who at 18 years claims he never experienced any of these.Marshal is already showing signs of astute leadership and motivational skills, with his name being counted among the region s top word-smiths.With already two books to his name and a series of accolades for his motivational work, Marshal is slowly carving his own piece of history and making a name for himself on the international scene through motivational writing and has become one of the youngest authors and motivational speakers in Zimbabwe. I am a simple boy who has trained himself to become a gentleman by choice, Marshal confidently asserted in an interview in Harare recently.In less than two years after finishing high school education, Marshal has successfully branded himself as an author and a motivational speaker with a deep conviction of unlimited possibilities, a development that has enabled him to further develop his brandWhile motivational speaking remains a domain for the mature, believed to be think tanks for social problems, having experienced some of them and could have interfaced with them at various stages of their lives, society is skeptical of young motivational speakers.That has not fazed Marshal, who argues that experience can be achieved within a minute, and cannot be used as basis to determine one s suitability for such a job.
