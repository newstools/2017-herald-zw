SYDNEY. &#8211; Younis Khan claimed his 34th Test cricket century and first in Australia as Pakistan struggled to stay alive in the final Test in Sydney yesterday. The 39-year-old Pakistani great became the first batsman to score Test hundreds in 11 countries as he turned around an indifferent series with his first century since October.He fought back from a dreadful mix-up which led to the run-out of the team s leading scorer of the series, Azhar Ali, to spearhead the Pakistan fightback on a rain-affected day three.Younis went to stumps on 136 off 279 balls with the tourists still trailing Australia by 267 runs and 68 from avoiding the follow-on. Pakistan were 271 for eight with Yasir Shah five not out. The tourists trail 2-0 in the Test series.Younis showed Australia his undoubted quality with 15 fours and a six off spinner Nathan Lyon, with his century coming off 208 balls.In 206 Test innings, Younis has only been dismissed once in the 90s with 91 against New Zealand in Auckland in 2001. Younis has been a great servant for Pakistan cricket and scoring a hundred here as well. Now he s scored a hundred in each Test-playing country, so it s a big achievement, Azhar said. It s probably his last tour to Australia so it s a really happy moment for each and everyone of us. - AFP
