THE new education curriculum is set to come into effect, with schools in the Matabeleland region saying they are ready for the changes. In separate interviews yesterday, Bulawayo, Matabeleland North and Matabeleland South Provincial Education Directors (PEDs) said they were ready to teach pupils using the new curriculum.Bulawayo Metropolitan province PED Mr Dan Moyo said nothing was going to prevent them from implementing the new curriculum. We received syllabi for all departments and the only setback we may have is parents failing to pay fees on time. Our Grade Zero and Form One pupils even managed to get places in various schools and we re ready for everything. Mr Moyo said although Bulawayo was in need of teachers to fill some places, his office was going to establish the exact number of teachers needed when schools open.Mrs Boithathelo Mnguni, the PED for Matabeleland North Province, said they were ready but had some vacancies. She said the new curriculum was all about refocusing and thinking differently about how traditional subjects are taught. For example, when teaching English Language, we now want to ensure that pupils also develop their poetry and theatre arts skills which they will use even after school to make a living. The new way of teaching requires training so that teachers teach the general subjects focusing on how the same could be useful in sustaining the child, Mrs Mnguni said. &#8211; Chronicle.&nbsp;
