Junior ZindogaSwedish club Djurg rdens IF have announced that highly-rated young Zimbabwe footballer Junior Zindoga arrived in Stockholm for a test game. He is a forward who will be here for a while and audition with us, we have not decided exactly how long. I connected him with Tino (Kade Werewolf) and Super Mush (Nyasha Mushekwi) so they have trained together in Zimbabwe during the leave. Junior has had a strong development so it will be exciting to follow him during his stay here, said sports director Bosse Andersson.Zindoga is an 18-year-old from St Georges College s A team. He is part of a number of teenage Zimbabwean footballers making a big impression with Tristan Nydam being promoted to the first team of English championship side Ipswich Town at the weekend where he was part of the substitutes.
