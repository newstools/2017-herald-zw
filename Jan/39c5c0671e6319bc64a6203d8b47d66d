SYDNEY. Russian teenager Daria Kasatkina put Angelique Kerber s Australian Open tennis preparations in a spin with a straight-sets upset win over the world number one at the Sydney International yesterday. The 19-year-old, ranked 26, underlined her huge potential with a confident performance to take out the German, 7-6 (7/5), 6-2 in a second-round match played in sweltering conditions.Only last week Kasatkina held a match point before going down to French Open champion Garbine Muguruza in the second round at the Brisbane International.While she continues her march, Kerber s form is a concern ahead of next week s opening Grand Slam of the year, having also lost to Ukraine s Elina Svitolina 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the quarter-finals of the Brisbane International last week.Kerber, who had a breakthrough 2016, winning two Grand Slams on her way to becoming world number one, struggled to find any rhythm and her usually strong forehand was astray.
