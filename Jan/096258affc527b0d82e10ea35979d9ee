LONDON. Valtteri Bottas was on Monday named as Lewis Hamilton s new teammate at Mercedes, the Finn replacing retired world champion Nico Rosberg after being freed to join the Formula One giants by Williams. The laid back 27-year-old s well-touted move to the all-conquering German constructor was facilitated by Williams persuading Felipe Massa to come out of retirement to race for them again in 2017.The Stuttgart-based Mercedes were left scrambling round for a second driver when Rosberg dramatically retired on December 2 just five days following his drivers title triumph.While Rosberg and Hamilton were arch-rivals, Bottas said at Mercedes Headquarters he wanted a good relationship. I think we are going to be a strong pair together, he said. I really respect him (Hamilton) as a driver and as a person. He is so quick, he is a great reference for me. I am sure we are going to be close and we are going to be both pushing each other forward. Hamilton took to Twitter to greet Rosberg s replacement. Welcome to the Team, Valtteri! the British driver wrote.Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff observed: It s time to see how Valtteri can step up to challenge for wins and Championships. Massa, who has raced for Williams since 2014, will be joined by Canadian teenage rookie Lance Stroll. AFP.
