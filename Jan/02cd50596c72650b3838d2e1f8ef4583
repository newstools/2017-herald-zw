LONDON. &#8211; A speed camera on one of London s busiest roads has generated fines of $1.85 million in just six months, making it the most profitable speed trap in Britain, it was disclosed Wednesday. London s Metropolitan Police said the camera on the North Circular Road at Ealing was responsible for a third of all speeding tickets issued in Britain s capital city. Critics say the camera has earned as much as a medium sized business. Although speed limits along the North Circular Road in London are generally 64 km/h to 80 km/h, the money-generating camera is catching motorists where a temporary 48 km/h limit is in operation.The figures were published by London s Evening Standard newspaper who gathered details through a Freedom of Information question.The newspaper said 14,544 drivers were slapped with fines of $123 during a six month period.Motorists complained that signs indicating a lower speed limit were not properly signposted. The motoring organisation, the RAC, was also critical, with its policy spokesman Nicholas Lyes saying motorists had fallen victim to a poorly signed temporary speed limit .Transport for London said the speed limit had been reduced to ensure the safety of all road users and contractors, adding there was clear signage in the area to advise drivers. - Xinhua
