The deadline for the registration of bulk water dealers has now passed and now the Zimbabwe National Water Authority has since received applications and registered a number of bulk water dealers. This registration is pursuant to the provisions of Statutory Instrument 90 of 2013 which compels all bulk water dealers to renew their licences no later than December 31 of each year.It is only after registration that a bulk water dealer can operate legally. Any bulk water dealing without the necessary registration is illegal and attracts prosecution and some attendant penalties from Zinwa.The Authority therefore appeals to all bulk water clients to ensure that they only get water from registered bulk water dealers.It is very risky to get water from unauthorised dealers as their water may be from sources that are unsuitable for human consumption.Zinwa ensures that water supplied by registered bulk water dealers is safe for consumption by carrying out random and sometimes periodic checks of the water sources as well as the vehicles that are used to transport the water.The authority also carries out regular quality checks of the water at source as well as in transit and these unsolicited checks are provided for in terms of Statutory Instrument 90 of 2013, hence dealing with registered bulk water dealers may insulate consumers from the risks that may arise from dealing with an unauthorised dealers.While Zinwa, which is empowered by law to keep and maintain a register of bulk water dealers, will make every effort to make public the names of bulk water dealers who have successfully registered to operate in 2017, the Authority also encourages interested members of the public to also visit Zinwa Groundwater offices where they can also access the register free of charge.This is a right accorded to the public in terms of Section 21 of Statutory Instrument 90 of 2013 which states that any person may inspect the register referred to in subsection (1) free of charge at all reasonable times at the premises of the authority or at such other place as the authority may direct. In this case, those interested are free to visit the Zinwa Groundwater Department at Number 9 Kent Road in Chisipite.The authority will also soon upload an updated list of bulk water dealers on its website while other communication platforms such as social media shall also be used to make public the list of approved dealers.Members of the public should therefore make use of this right accorded to them in terms of the law to know the registered bulk water dealers and rid themselves of the risks associated with dealing with illegal suppliers.This will allow the public to also play its part in helping flush out illegal dealers who, apart from endangering lives, are also distorting the bulk water demand, making groundwater resources planning very difficult.When in question, members of the public can also contact Zinwa and verify or report any suspected illegal use through the Zinwa Call Centre.&nbsp;For more information please contact the ZINWA Corporate Communications and Marketing Department on pr@zinwa.co.zw or callcentre@zinwa.co.zw.
