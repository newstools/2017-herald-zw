Senior Agriculture Reporter&#8212;The African armyworm has been a challenge to farmers in Zimbabwe.The pest originates from Zambia, Uganda or Tanzania and is carried by strong winds from one area to another. The armyworm is the larvae stage of a moth that is common in Southern Africa. The moth is easily identified by the colour of its wings which are dark brown with black spots, while hind wings are white with dark edges. The migratory moths travel in multitudes and cover long distances during the night. They can cross national boundaries within a short period while being driven by winds.Experts note that the moths follow humid areas and lay eggs at a very fast rate. A female can lay up to 800 eggs within five weeks.The armyworm can wipe out the whole crop during the night if not controlled on time, as it has a monster appetite for foliage.Young armyworms are small and it is hard to see them, but the best time to check for the pest is in the morning or evening.Farmers can expect an armyworm outbreak when they see sudden swarms of moths around cooking fires and candles.Armyworm caterpillars are most dangerous when in their gregarious form when they gather together in large numbers on plants.In this form, the caterpillars are 30mm long and have dark stripes that make them appear black.Agricultural experts always urged farmers to continue scouting for the pests and advise them to report to any nearest Agritex or Government office if they see the pest or if they suspect its presence.
