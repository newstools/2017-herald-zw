JOHANNESBURG. &#8211; Hashim Amla made a century in his 100th Test cricket match as he and JP Duminy put South Africa in command on the first day of the third and final Test against Sri Lanka yesterday. South Africa reached 338 for three at the close of play, with Amla unbeaten on 124 at the Wanderers Stadium.Duminy made 155 before he was caught at second slip off Lahiru Kumara in the penultimate over of the day, ending a third wicket partnership of 192.Amla became the eighth player and second South African after former captain Graeme Smith to mark 100 Tests with a hundred.After a lean run of form, Amla struggled early in his innings.The left-handed Duminy was the dominant partner as he shepherded Amla, who was dropped by Dhananjaya de Silva at gully off Suranga Lakmal when he had five.Amla only scored six in the pair s first 50 runs together. Gradually, though, Amla found his timing and he reached his first half-century in 11 Test matches shortly before tea. He had faced 109 balls and hit seven fours.He blossomed to hit his second half-century off only 60 balls, reaching his 26th Test hundred when he skipped down the wicket and lofted Rangana Herath over mid-off for his 14th four.Duminy, by contrast, cruised to his half-century off 62 balls with ten boundaries and went on to his sixth Test century after facing 140 deliveries and adding four more boundaries.Duminy s previous highest score in three previous Tests at the Wanderers was 29. - AFP
