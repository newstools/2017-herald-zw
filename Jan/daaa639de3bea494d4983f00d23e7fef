MANCHESTER. Jose Mourinho told Wayne Rooney his best day is still to come after he equalled Manchester United s scoring record in their 4-0 FA Cup win over Championship side Reading on Saturday. Rooney (31) scored his 249th goal for the club to match Bobby Charlton s record, set in March 1973, as United made it eight wins in a row - their best run since September 2009. Rooney could now break the record against Hull City in tomorrow s League Cup semi-final first leg and United manager Mourinho said: I think the best day for him will arrive. His best day will be the next goal. If he scores the next goal, he becomes the top scorer in the history of Manchester United. It s amazing because everyone knows who Sir Bobby is and what he means for the club. So for Wayne to score as many goals as him for Manchester United is fantastic. Rooney turned provider to set up Anthony Martial for United s second goal at Old Trafford in Saturday s third-round tie before Marcus Rashford broke his 17-match goal drought with a second-half double.Rooney was delighted to make history after matching a record that has stood for almost 44 years, particularly with Charlton watching on from the directors box. This club is a huge part of my life and I m honoured to be up there alongside Sir Bobby, he said. It s a proud moment. To do it at a massive club like Manchester United, I m hugely honoured. Reading boss Jaap Stam, making his first return to Old Trafford as a manager after his hugely successful time as a United player from 1998 to 2001, also paid tribute to Rooney. AFP.
