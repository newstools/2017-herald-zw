Tawanda Marwizi Arts Correspondent &#8212; Chitungwiza Arts Centre, one of the finest art galleries in Zimbabwe, celebrates its 20 years of existence this year. Formerly Gallery City, the centre was established in 1997 after several sculptors established their sculpting bases in the city and decided to come together at once centre. Sculptors such as Albert Mamvura, Fanizani Akuda, Bernard and Lazurus Takawira and Sylvester Mubayi established home studios from where they trained young artists. Chairman of the centre Taurai Tigere said these sculptors united in forming the centre. There was need now to find a central place where the stone carvers would work from. So they decided to establish the arts centre. It has produced a number of sculptors who won several awards, he said.The first few years the centre was under the care of a coordinator but in 2000 the project was handed over to the artists to chart their way forward towards sustainability and future progress. Without funding and lack of original stakeholder input the artists coming from different suburbs in Chitungwiza became an organised group and crafted their first association constitution to govern and direct their affairs into the future, said Tigere.Later on the centre hosted a number of exhibitions that managed to take the artistes to the limelight.Some of the artists who have local and international recognition are Onias Mupumha (2008 NAMA Award Winner), Ishmael Chitiyo, Peter Gwisa, Washington Matafi, Rufaro Murenza (2015 NAMA Award Winner), Morgan Tago Tazvitya, Daina Nyakudya, Tracy Chatsama, Tendai Chareka, Farai Tandi (2016 NAMA Award Winner), Athony Ngandu (2014 NAMA Nominee), Tendekayi Tandi, Victor Matafi, Wiston Nyekete, Timothy Rukodzi, Rickson Zavare, Tonderai Sowa and Tigere.Tigere said they have lined a massive exhibition that will mark the 20th anniversary for the centre. This year, Chitungwiza Arts Centre shall be hosting an anniversary exhibition and competition celebrating the past achievements, our unity and vision for the future.However, more needs to be done in terms of structural developments so as to meet the mission of promotion and advancement of all art disciplines in the centre, he added.
