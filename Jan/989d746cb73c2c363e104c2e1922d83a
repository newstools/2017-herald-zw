In a crucial step, Greek Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci late Wednesday exchanged maps detailing their visions of how internal boundaries should be redrawn.Turkish Cypriot leaders have agreed in principle to return some of the land they have controlled since the failed 1974 coup.
