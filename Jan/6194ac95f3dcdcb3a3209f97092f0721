EKURHULENI. Thama Jeffrey Nkonyane is about to collect the biggest cheque of his 32-year long career after helping England s Graeme Storm to victory in the South African Open golf tournament at a packed and trilled Glendower on Sunday. The Englishman went toe-to-toe with Rory McIlroy, but came out on top at the third playoff hole.Storm might have weathered the onslaught of the world s number two player, but a tsunami is about to hit Nkonyane s bank account after the 37-year-old Storm pocketed R2.3 million for his efforts. This will definitely be the biggest pay-day of my life and of course the money is going to be great, but this is proudest day of my career, said the 51-year-old from Soweto. It was very special to win the SA Open in front of my home crowd with Graeme, because we ve known each other more than 20 years. AFP.
