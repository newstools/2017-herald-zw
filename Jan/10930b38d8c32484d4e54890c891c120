ARUSHA. Refugees will not be allowed to enter Tanzania in groups, the country s home affairs minister announced on Tuesday. Mwigulu Nchemba made the announcement in western Tanzania s region of Kigoma where he oversaw the dismantlement of 5 608 illegal firearms. Proliferation of arms and ammunitions in Tanzania is largely believed to be fuelled by refugees from troubled neighbouring countries seeking shelter in the east African nation.The minister said the decision came after realising that not all those who claim to be refugees are genuinely in need of protection and shelter in a foreign land. According to Nchemba, those seeking refuge will be considered as individuals and be allowed in only after they pass checks.The minister said in the past, people used to approach authorities in groups of tens and hundreds and they were easily granted refuge without thorough checks. Before, only one person would speak on behalf of tens or hundreds of arrivals. That has ended from today (Tuesday), he announced.He further said the groups also included families and individuals who had poor harvest and feared hunger in their countries. Such people took advantage of instability in their countries and smoothly gained entry into Tanzania.Tanzania is hosting more than 200 000 refugees from Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia and a few others from Rwanda, Uganda, South Sudan and Ethiopia. Refugee camps are situated in western regions of Katavi, Tabora, Kigoma, and Kagera. Xinhua.
