MANCHESTER. Jos Mourinho implored Manchester United fans not to come to the theatre for Sunday s visit of Liverpool if they want to help the side try to beat J rgen Klopp s team. United dominated Hull City throughout Tuesday night s 2-0 first-leg victory in the EFL Cup semi-final at Old Trafford but had to wait until the 56th minute for Juan Mata to break the deadlock.Mourinho, who saw his side record a ninth successive victory in all competitions, was clear that unless supporters, players, and himself improve United will struggle to defeat their fiercest rivals in what will be a pivotal English Premier League match with Liverpool in second place, five points ahead of t he Portuguese s side.While Marouane Fellaini, a second-half substitute, scored late on to give United a comfortable cushion for the return leg at the KCom Stadium, Mourinho was displeased.
