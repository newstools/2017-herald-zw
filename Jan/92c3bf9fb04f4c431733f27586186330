Olivier Giroud has claimed all of the Arsenal team want Arsene Wenger to sign a new contract.Wenger is in the final six months of his contract and has vowed to wait and see how this season pans out before deciding his future.

We hope that the boss will sign a new contract because we all want to keep going with this squad and even the other players, Giroud said. It s nice news for the team, for the club and from my side obviously it s a good thing (for him to renew his contract) at Arsenal. I really want to carry on to win the league and to always improve myself. Wenger s future could also have an impact on other members of the squad besides Giroud, with Mesut Ozil hinting his future hinges on the 67-year-old staying.In an interview with the German magazine Kicker this month, Ozil said: I am very happy at Arsenal and have let the club know I would be ready to sign a new contract.
